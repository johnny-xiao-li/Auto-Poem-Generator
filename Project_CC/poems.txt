Desiring this mans art and that mans scope
With what I most enjoy contented least
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising
Haply I think on thee and then my state
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate
For thy sweet love rememberd such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings
Lord of my love to whom in vassalage
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
To thee I send this written embassage
To witness duty not to show my wit
Duty so great which wit so poor as mine
May make seem bare in wanting words to show it
But that I hope some good conceit of thine
In thy souls thought all naked will bestow it
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving
Points on me graciously with fair aspect
And puts apparel on my tatterd loving
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee
Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me
Weary with toil I haste me to my bed
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired
But then begins a journey in my head
To work my mind when bodys works expired
For then my thoughts from far where I abide
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide
Looking on darkness which the blind do see
Save that my souls imaginary sight
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view
Which like a jewel hung in ghastly night
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new
Lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
For thee and for myself no quiet find
How can I then return in happy plight
That am debarrd the benefit of rest
When days oppression is not eased by night
But day by night and night by day oppressd
And each though enemies to eithers reign
Do in consent shake hands to torture me
The one by toil the other to complain
How far I toil still farther off from thee
I tell the day to please them thou art bright
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
So flatter I the swartcomplexiond night
When sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
And night doth nightly make griefs strength seem stronger
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought
And with old woes new wail my dear times waste
Then can I drown an eye unusd to flow
For precious friends hid in deaths dateless night
And weep afresh loves long since cancelld woe
And moan the expense of many a vanishd sight
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone
And heavily from woe to woe tell oer
The sad account of forebemoaned moan
Which I new pay as if not paid before
But if the while I think on thee dear friend
All losses are restord and sorrows end
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
Which I by lacking have supposed dead
And there reigns love and all loves loving parts
And all those friends which I thought buried
How many a holy and obsequious tear
Hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye
As interest of the dead which now appear
But things removed that hidden in thee lie
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
Who all their parts of me to thee did give
That due of many now is thine alone
Their images I loved I view in thee
And thou all they hast all the all of me
If thou survive my wellcontented day
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover
And shalt by fortune once more resurvey
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
Compare them with the bettering of the time
And though they be outstrippd by every pen
Reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
Exceeded by the height of happier men
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
Had my friends Muse grown with this growing age
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
To march in ranks of better equipage
But since he died and poets better prove
Theirs for their style Ill read his for his love
Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Flatter the mountaintops with sovereign eye
Kissing with golden face the meadows green
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
With ugly rack on his celestial face
And from the forlorn world his visage hide
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
Even so my sun one early morn did shine
With all triumphant splendor on my brow
But out alack he was but one hour mine
The region cloud hath maskd him from me now
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
Suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
And make me travel forth without my cloak
To let base clouds oertake me in my way
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke
Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
To dry the rain on my stormbeaten face
For no man well of such a salve can speak
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
Though thou repent yet I have still the loss
The offenders sorrow lends but weak relief
To him that bears the strong offences cross
Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds
O how thy worth with manners may I sing
When thou art all the better part of me
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring
And what is t but mine own when I praise thee
Even for this let us divided live
And our dear love lose name of single one
That by this separation I may give
That due to thee which thou deservest alone
O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
To entertain the time with thoughts of love
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
And that thou teachest how to make one twain
By praising him here who doth hence remain
No more be grieved at that which thou hast done
Roses have thorns and silver fountains mud
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
All men make faults and even I in this
Authorizing thy trespass with compare
Myself corrupting salving thy amiss
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense
Thy adverse party is thy advocate
And gainst myself a lawful plea commence
Such civil war is in my love and hate
That I an accessary needs must be
To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me
Let me confess that we two must be twain
Although our undivided loves are one
So shall those blots that do with me remain
Without thy help by me be borne alone
In our two loves there is but one respect
Though in our lives a separable spite
Which though it alter not loves sole effect
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight
I may not evermore acknowledge thee
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
Nor thou with public kindness honour me
Unless thou take that honour from thy name
But do not so I love thee in such sort
As thou being mine mine is thy good report
As a decrepit father takes delight
To see his active child do deeds of youth
So I made lame by fortunes dearest spite
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
For whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
Or any of these all or all or more
Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit
I make my love engrafted to this store
So then I am not lame poor nor despised
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
That I in thy abundance am sufficed
And by a part of all thy glory live
Look what is best that best I wish in thee
This wish I have then ten times happy me
How can my muse want subject to invent
While thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse
Thine own sweet argument too excellent
For every vulgar paper to rehearse
O give thy self the thanks if aught in me
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight
For whos so dumb that cannot write to thee
When thou thy self dost give invention light
Be thou the tenth Muse ten times more in worth
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate
And he that calls on thee let him bring forth
Eternal numbers to outlive long date
If my slight muse do please these curious days
The pain be mine but thine shall be the praise
Alas tis true I have gone here and there
And made myself a motley to the view
Gord mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear
Made old offences of affections new
Most true it is that I have lookd on truth
Askance and strangely but by all above
These blenches gave my heart another youth
And worse essays provd thee my best of love
Now all is done have what shall have no end
Mine appetite I never more will grind
On newer proof to try an older friend
A god in love to whom I am confind
Then give me welcome next my heaven the best
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast
Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
these rebel powers that thee array
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay
Why so large cost having so short a lease
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
Shall worms inheritors of this excess
Eat up thy charge Is this thy bodys end
Then soul live thou upon thy servants loss
And let that pine to aggravate thy store
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
Within be fed without be rich no more
So shalt thou feed on Death that feeds on men
And Death once dead theres no more dying then
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds
Or bends with the remover to remove
O no it is an everfixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken
It is the star to every wandring bark
Whose worths unknown although his height be taken
Loves not Times fool though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickles compass come
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
But bears it out even to the edge of doom
If this be error and upon me provd
I never writ nor no man ever lovd
SHALL I compare thee to a Summers day
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
And Summers lease hath all too short a date
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
And often is his gold complexion dimmd
And every fair from fair sometime declines
By chance or natures changing course untrimmd
But thy eternal Summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest
Nor shall Death brag thou wanderest in his shade
When in eternal lines to time thou growest
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see
So long lives this and this gives life to thee
WHEN in disgrace with Fortune and mens eyes
I all alone beweep my outcast state
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
And look upon myself and curse my fate
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope
Featured like him like him with friends possest
Desiring this mans art and that mans scope
With what I most enjoy contented least
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising
Haply I think on thee and then my state
Like to the Lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth sings hymns at Heavens gate
For thy sweet love remembred such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with Kings
WHEN to the Sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought
And with old woes new wail my dear times waste
Then can I drown an eye unused to flow
For precious friends hid in deaths dateless night
And weep afresh loves longsincecancelld woe
And moan th expense of many a vanishd sight
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone
And heavily from woe to woe tell oer
The sad account of forebemoaned moan
Which I new pay as if not paid before
But if the while I think on thee dear friend
All losses are restored and sorrows end
THY bosom is endeared with all hearts
Which I by lacking have supposed dead
And there reigns Love and all Loves loving parts
And all those friends which I thought buried
How many a holy and obsequious tear
Hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye
As interest of the deadwhich now appear
But things removed that hidden in thee lie
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
Who all their parts of me to thee did give
That due of many now is thine alone
Their images I loved I view in thee
And thou all they hast all the all of me
WHAT is your substance whereof are you made
That millions of strange shadows on you tend
Since every one hath every one one shade
And you but one can every shadow lend
Describe Adonis and the counterfeit
Is poorly imitated after you
On Helens cheek all art of beauty set
And you in Grecian tires are painted new
Speak of the spring and foison of the year
The one doth shadow of your beauty show
The other as your bounty doth appear
And you in every blessed shape we know
In all external grace you have some part
But you like none none you for constant heart
FAREWELL thou art too dear for my possessing
And like enough thou knowst thy estimate
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
My bonds in thee are all determinate
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting
And for that riches where is my deserving
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
And so my patent back again is swerving
Thyself thou gavst thy own worth then not knowing
Or me to whom thou gavst it else mistaking
So thy great gift upon misprision growing
Comes home again on better judgment making
Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter
In sleep a King but waking no such matter
What is your substance whereof are you made
That millions of strange shadows on you tend
Since everyone hath everyone one shade
And you but one can every shadow lend
Describe Adonis and the counterfeit
Is poorly imitated after you
On Helens cheek all art of beauty set
And you in Grecian tires are painted new
Speak of the spring and foison of the year
The one doth shadow of your beauty show
The other as your bounty doth appear
And you in every blessed shape we know
In all external grace you have some part
But you like none none you for constant heart
Like as the waves make towards the pebbld shore
So do our minutes hasten to their end
Each changing place with that which goes before
In sequent toil all forwards do contend
Nativity once in the main of light
Crawls to maturity wherewith being crownd
Crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
And delves the parallels in beautys brow
Feeds on the rarities of natures truth
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
Praising thy worth despite his cruel hand
IT was a lordings daughter the fairest one of three
That liked of her master as well as well might be
Till looking on an Englishman the fairst that eye could see
Her fancy fell aturning
Long was the combat doubtful that love with love did fight
To leave the master loveless or kill the gallant knight
To put in practise either alas it was a spite
Unto the silly damsel
But one must be refused more mickle was the pain
That nothing could be used to turn them both to gain
For of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain
Alas she could not help it
Thus art with arms contending was victor of the day
Which by a gift of learning did bear the maid away
Then lullaby the learned man hath got the lady gay
For now my song is ended
On a day alack the day
Love whose month was ever May
Spied a blossom passing fair
Playing in the wanton air
Through the velvet leaves the wind
All unseen gan passage find
That the lover sick to death
Wishd himself the heavens breath
Air quoth he thy cheeks may blow
Air would I might triumph so
But alas my hand hath sworn
Neer to pluck thee from thy thorn
Vow alack for youth unmeet
Youth so apt to pluck a sweet
Thou for whom Jove would swear
Juno but an Ethiope were
Turning mortal for thy love
My flocks feed not
My ewes breed not
My rams speed not
All is amiss
Loves denying
Faiths defying
Hearts renying
Causer of this
All my merry jigs are quite forgot
All my ladys love is lost God wot
Where her faith was firmly fixd in love
There a nay is placed without remove
One silly cross
Wrought all my loss
O frowning Fortune cursed fickle dame
For now I see
Inconstancy
More in women than in men remain
In black mourn I
All fears scorn I
Love hath forlorn me
Living in thrall
Heart is bleeding
All help needing
O cruel speeding
Fraughted with gall
My shepherds pipe can sound no deal
My wethers bell rings doleful knell
My curtail dog that wont to have playd
Plays not at all but seems afraid
My sighs so deep
Procure to weep
In howling wise to see my doleful plight
How sighs resound
Through heartless ground
Like a thousand vanquishd men in bloody fight
Clear wells spring not
Sweet birds sing not
Green plants bring not
Forth their dye
Herds stand weeping
Flocks all sleeping
Nymphs back peeping
Fearfully
All our pleasure known to us poor swains
All our merry meetings on the plains
All our evening sport from us is fled
All our love is lost for Love is dead
Farewell sweet lass
Thy like neer was
For a sweet content the cause of all my moan
Poor Corydon
Must live alone
Other help for him I see that there is none
When as thine eye hath chose the dame
And stalld the deer that thou shouldst strike
Let reason rule things worthy blame
As well as fancy partial might
Take counsel of some wiser head
Neither too young nor yet unwed
And when thou comest thy tale to tell
Smooth not thy tongue with filed talk
Lest she some subtle practise smell
A cripple soon can find a halt
But plainly say thou lovest her well
And set thy person forth to sell
What though her frowning brows be bent
Her cloudy looks will calm ere night
And then too late she will repent
That thus dissembled her delight
And twice desire ere it be day
That which with scorn she put away
What though she strive to try her strength
And ban and brawl and say thee nay
Her feeble force will yield at length
When craft hath taught her thus to say
Had women been so strong as men
In faith you had not had it then
And to her will frame all thy ways
Spare not to spend and chiefly there
Where thy desert may merit praise
By ringing in thy ladys ear
The strongest castle tower and town
The golden bullet beats it down
Serve always with assured trust
And in thy suit be humble true
Unless thy lady prove unjust
Press never thou to choose anew
When time shall serve be thou not slack
To proffer though she put thee back
The wiles and guiles that women work
Dissembled with an outward show
The tricks and toys that in them lurk
The cock that treads them shall not know
Have you not heard it said full oft
A womans nay doth stand for nought
Think women still to strive with men
To sin and never for to saint
There is no heaven by holy then
When time with age doth them attaint
Were kisses all the joys in bed
One woman would another wed
But soft enough too much I fear
Lest that my mistress hear my song
She will not stick to round me i the ear
To teach my tongue to be so long
Yet will she blush here be it said
To hear her secrets so bewrayd
Live with me and be my love
And we will all the pleasures prove
That hills and valleys dales and fields
And all the craggy mountains yields
There will we sit upon the rocks
And see the shepherds feed their flocks
By shallow rivers by whose falls
Melodious birds sing madrigals
There will I make thee a bed of roses
With a thousand fragrant posies
A cap of flowers and a kirtle
Embroiderd all with leaves of myrtle
A belt of straw and ivy buds
With coral clasps and amber studs
And if these pleasures may thee move
Then live with me and be my love
LOVES ANSWER
If that the world and love were young
And truth in every shepherds tongue
These pretty pleasures might me move
To live with thee and be thy love
As it fell upon a day
In the merry month of May
Sitting in a pleasant shade
Which a grove of myrtles made
Beasts did leap and birds did sing
Trees did grow and plants did spring
Every thing did banish moan
Save the nightingale alone
She poor bird as all forlorn
Leand her breast uptill a thorn
And there sung the dolefullst ditty
That to hear it was great pity
Fie fie fie now would she cry
Tereu tereu by and by
That to hear her so complain
Scarce I could from tears refrain
For her griefs so lively shown
Made me think upon mine own
Ah thought I thou mournst in vain
None takes pity on thy pain
Senseless trees they cannot hear thee
Ruthless beasts they will not cheer thee
King Pandion he is dead
All thy friends are lappd in lead
All thy fellow birds do sing
Careless of thy sorrowing
Even so poor bird like thee
None alive will pity me
Whilst as fickle Fortune smiled
Thou and I were both beguiled
Every one that flatters thee
Is no friend in misery
Words are easy like the wind
Faithful friends are hard to find
Every man will be thy friend
Whilst thou hast wherewith to spend
But if store of crowns be scant
No man will supply thy want
If that one be prodigal
Bountiful they will him call
And with suchlike flattering
Pity but he were a king
If he be addict to vice
Quickly him they will entice
If to women he be bent
They have at commandement
But if Fortune once do frown
Then farewell his great renown
They that fawnd on him before
Use his company no more
He that is thy friend indeed
He will help thee in thy need
If thou sorrow he will weep
If thou wake he cannot sleep
Thus of every grief in heart
He with thee doth bear a part
These are certain signs to know
Faithful friend from flattering foe
O HOW much more doth beauty beauteous seem
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give
The Rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
For that sweet odour which doth in it live
The Cankerblooms have full as deep a dye
As the perfumed tincture of the Roses
Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
When summers breath their masked buds discloses
Butfor their virtue only is their show
They live unwood and unrespected fade
Die to themselves Sweet Roses do not so
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
And so of you beauteous and lovely youth
When that shall vade my verse distils your truth
BEING your slave what should I do but tend
Upon the hours and times of your desire
I have no precious time at all to spend
Nor services to do till you require
Nor dare I chide the worldwithoutend hour
Whilst I my sovereign watch the clock for you
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
When you have bid your servant once adieu
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
Where you may be or your affairs suppose
But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
Save where you are how happy you make those
So true a fool is love that in your Will
Though you do any thing he thinks no ill
THAT time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves or none or few do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold
Bare ruind choirs where late the sweet birds sang
In me thou seest the twilight of such day
As after Sunset fadeth in the West
Which by and by black night doth take away
Deaths second self that seals up all in rest
In me thou seest the glowing of such fire
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie
As the deathbed whereon it must expire
Consumed with that which it was nourishd by
This thou perceivst which makes thy love more strong
To love that well which thou must leave ere long
THEN hate me when thou wilt if ever now
Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
Join with the spite of fortune make me bow
And do not drop in for an after loss
Ah do not when my heart hath scaped this sorrow
Come in the rearward of a conquerd woe
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow
To linger out a purposed overthrow
If thou wilt leave me do not leave me last
When other petty griefs have done their spite
But in the onset come so shall I taste
At first the very worst of fortunes might
And other strains of woe which now seem woe
Compared with loss of thee will not seem so
They that have power to hurt and will do none
That do not do the thing they most do show
Who moving others are themselves as stone
Unmoved cold and to temptation slow
They rightly do inherit heavens graces
And husband natures riches from expense
They are the lords and owners of their faces
Others but stewards of their excellence
The summers flower is to the summer sweet
Though to itself it only live and die
But if that flower with base infection meet
The basest weed outbraves his dignity
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds
THEY that have power to hurt and will do none
That do not do the thing they most do show
Who moving others are themselves as stone
Unmoved cold and to temptation slow
They rightly do inherit heavens graces
And husband natures riches from expense
They are the Lords and owners of their faces
Others but stewards of their excellence
The summers flower is to the summer sweet
Though to itself it only live and die
But if that flower with base infection meet
The basest weed outbraves his dignity
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds
HOW like a Winter hath my absence been
From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
What freezings have I felt what dark days seen
What old Decembers bareness everywhere
And yet this time removed was summers time
The teeming Autumn big with rich increase
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime
Like widowd wombs after their Lords decease
Yet this abundant issue seemd to me
But hope of orphans and unfatherd fruit
For Summer and his pleasures wait on thee
And thou away the very birds are mute
Or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer
That leaves look pale dreading the Winter s near
FROM you have I been absent in the spring
When proudpied April dressd in all his trim
Hath put a spirit of youth in everything
That heavy Saturn laughd and leapd with him
Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
Of different flowers in odour and in hue
Could make me any summers story tell
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
Nor did I wonder at the Lilys white
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the Rose
They were but sweet but figures of delight
Drawn after you you pattern of all those
Yet seemd it Winter still and you away
As with your shadow I with these did play
MY love is strengthend though more weak in seeming
I love not less though less the show appear
That love is merchandised whose rich esteeming
The owners tongue doth publish everywhere
Our love was new and then but in the spring
When I was wont to greet it with my lays
As Philomel in summers front doth sing
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days
Not that the summer is less pleasant now
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
But that wild music burthens every bough
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight
Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue
Because I would not dull you with my song
Devouring Time blunt thou the lions paws
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws
And burn the longlivd Phoenix in her blood
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets
And do whateer thou wilt swiftfooted Time
To the wide world and all her fading sweets
But I forbid thee one more heinous crime
O carve not with the hours my loves fair brow
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
Him in thy course untainted do allow
For beautys pattern to succeeding men
Yet do thy worst old Time Despite thy wrong
My love shall in my verse ever live young
TH expense of Spirit in a waste of shame
Is lust in action and till action lust
Is perjured murderous bloody full of blame
Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
Enjoyd no sooner but despised straight
Past reason hunted and no sooner had
Past reason hated as a swallowd bait
On purpose laid to make the taker mad
Mad in pursuit and in possession so
Had having and in quest to have extreme
A bliss in proof and proved a very woe
Before a joy proposed behind a dream
All this the world well knows yet none knows well
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
TO me fair friend you never can be old
For as you were when first your eye I eyed
Such seems your beauty still Three Winters cold
Have from the forests shook three Summers pride
Three beauteous springs to yellow Autumn turnd
In process of the seasons have I seen
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burnd
Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green
Ah yet doth beauty like a dialhand
Steal from his figure and no pace perceived
So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
For fear of which hear this thou age unbred
Ere you were born was beautys summer dead
WHEN in the chronicle of wasted time
I see descriptions of the fairest wights
And beauty making beautiful old rime
In praise of Ladies dead and lovely Knights
Then in the blazon of sweet beautys best
Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
I see their antique pen would have exprest
Even such a beauty as you master now
So all their praises are but prophecies
Of this our time all you prefiguring
And for they lookd but with divining eyes
They had not skill enough your worth to sing
For we which now behold these present days
Have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise
O NEVER say that I was false of heart
Though absence seemd my flame to qualify
As easy might I from myself depart
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
That is my home of love if I have ranged
Like him that travels I return again
Just to the time not with the time exchanged
So that myself bring water for my stain
Never believe though in my nature reignd
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
That it could so prepostrously be staind
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good
For nothing this wide Universe I call
Save thou my Rose in it thou art my all
Shall I compare thee to a summers day
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
And summers lease hath all too short a date
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
And often is his gold complexion dimmd
And every fair from fair sometime declines
By chance or natures changing course untrimmd
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owst
Nor shall Death brag thou wanderst in his shade
When in eternal lines to time thou growst
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see
So long lives this and this gives life to thee
LET me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds
Or bends with the remover to remove
O no it is an everfixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken
It is the star to every wandring bark
Whose worth s unknown although his height be taken
Love s not Times fool though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickles compass come
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
But bears it out even to the edge of doom
If this be error and upon me proved
I never writ nor no man ever loved
POOR soul the centre of my sinful earth
My sinful earth these rebel powers array
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay
Why so large cost having so short a lease
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
Shall worms inheritors of this excess
Eat up thy charge Is this thy bodys end
Then soul live thou upon thy servants loss
And let that pine to aggravate thy store
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
Within be fed without be rich no more
So shalt thou feed on Death that feeds on men
And Death once dead there s no more dying then
When in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes
I all alone beweep my outcast state
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
And look upon myself and curse my fate
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope
Featurd like him like him with friends possessd
Desiring this mans art and that mans scope
With what I most enjoy contented least
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising
Haply I think on thee and then my state
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate
For thy sweet love rememberd such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings
Let those who are in favour with their stars
Of public honour and proud titles boast
Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars
Unlookd for joy in that I honour most
Great princes favourites their fair leaves spread
But as the marigold at the suns eye
And in themselves their pride lies buried
For at a frown they in their glory die
The painful warrior famoused for fight
After a thousand victories once foild
Is from the book of honour razed quite
And all the rest forgot for which he toild
Then happy I that love and am beloved
Where I may not remove nor be removed
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought
And with old woes new wail my dear times waste
Then can I drown an eye unusd to flow
For precious friends hid in deaths dateless night
And weep afresh loves long since cancelld woe
And moan th expense of many a vanishd sight
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone
And heavily from woe to woe tell oer
The sad account of forebemoaned moan
Which I new pay as if not paid before
But if the while I think on thee dear friend
All losses are restord and sorrows end
Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Flatter the mountaintops with sovereign eye
Kissing with golden face the meadows green
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
With ugly rack on his celestial face
And from the forlorn world his visage hide
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
Even so my sun one early morn did shine
With alltriumphant splendour on my brow
But out alack he was but one hour mine
The region cloud hath maskd him from me now
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
Suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth
Friends Romans countrymen lend me your ears
I come to bury Caesar not to praise him
The evil that men do lives after them
The good is oft interred with their bones
So let it be with Caesar The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious
If it were so it was a grievous fault
And grievously hath Caesar answerd it
Here under leave of Brutus and the rest
For Brutus is an honourable man
So are they all all honourable men
Come I to speak in Caesars funeral
He was my friend faithful and just to me
But Brutus says he was ambitious
And Brutus is an honourable man
He hath brought many captives home to Rome
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious
When that the poor have cried Caesar hath wept
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious
And Brutus is an honourable man
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown
Which he did thrice refuse was this ambition
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious
And sure he is an honourable man
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke
But here I am to speak what I do know
You all did love him once not without cause
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him
O judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts
And men have lost their reason Bear with me
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar
And I must pause till it come back to me
from Macbeth spoken by Macbeth
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death Out out brief candle
Lifes but a walking shadow a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more It is a tale
Told by an idiot full of sound and fury
Signifying nothing
WHEN daisies pied and violets blue
And ladysmocks all silverwhite
And cuckoobuds of yellow hue
Do paint the meadows with delight
The cuckoo then on every tree
Mocks married men for thus sings he
Cuckoo
Cuckoo cuckoo O word of fear
Unpleasing to a married ear
When shepherds pipe on oaten straws
And merry larks are ploughmens clocks
When turtles tread and rooks and daws
And maidens bleach their summer smocks
The cuckoo then on every tree
Mocks married men for thus sings he
Cuckoo
Cuckoo cuckoo O word of fear
Unpleasing to a married ear
WESTMORELAND O that we now had here
But one ten thousand of those men in England
That do no work today
KING What is he that wishes so
My cousin Westmoreland No my fair cousin
If we are marked to die we are enow
To do our country loss and if to live
The fewer men the greater share of honour
Gods will I pray thee wish not one man more
By Jove I am not covetous for gold
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost
It yearns me not if men my garments wear
Such outward things dwell not in my desires
But if it be a sin to covet honour
I am the most offending soul alive
No faith my coz wish not a man from England
Gods peace I would not lose so great an honour
As one man more methinks would share from me
For the best hope I have O do not wish one more
Rather proclaim it Westmoreland through my host
That he which hath no stomach to this fight
Let him depart his passport shall be made
And crowns for convoy put into his purse
We would not die in that mans company
That fears his fellowship to die with us
This day is calld the feast of Crispian
He that outlives this day and comes safe home
Will stand a tiptoe when this day is named
And rouse him at the name of Crispian
He that shall live this day and see old age
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours
And say Tomorrow is Saint Crispian
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars
And say These wounds I had on Crispians day
Old men forget yet all shall be forgot
But hell remember with advantages
What feats he did that day Then shall our names
Familiar in his mouth as household words
Harry the King Bedford and Exeter
Warwick and Talbot Salisbury and Gloucester
Be in their flowing cups freshly remembered
This story shall the good man teach his son
And Crispin Crispian shall never go by
From this day to the ending of the world
But we in it shall be remembered
We few we happy few we band of brothers
For he today that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother be he never so vile
This day shall gentle his condition
And gentlemen in England nowabed
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
That fought with us upon Saint Crispins day
TAKE O take those lips away
That so sweetly were forsworn
And those eyes the break of day
Lights that do mislead the morn
But my kisses bring again
Bring again
Seals of love but seald in vain
Seald in vain
That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves or none or few do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold
Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang
In me thou seest the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west
Which by and by black night doth take away
Deaths second self that seals all up in rest
In me thou seest the glowing of such fire
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie
As the deathbed whereon it must expire
Consumed with that which it was nourished by
This thou perceivst which makes thy love more strong
To love that well which thou must leave ere long
ON a dayalack the day
Love whose month is ever May
Spied a blossom passing fair
Playing in the wanton air
Through the velvet leaves the wind
All unseen gan passage find
That the lover sick to death
Wishd himself the heavens breath
Air quoth he thy cheeks may blow
Air would I might triumph so
But alack my hand is sworn
Neer to pluck thee from thy thorn
Vow alack for youth unmeet
Youth so apt to pluck a sweet
Do not call it sin in me
That I am forsworn for thee
Thou for whom een Jove would swear
Juno but an Ethiop were
And deny himself for Jove
Turning mortal for thy love
And let me the canakin clink clink
And let me the canakin clink
A soldiers a man
A lifes but a span
Why then let a soldier drink
In the old age black was not counted fair
Or if it were it bore not beautys name
But now is black beautys successive heir
And beauty slandered with a bastard shame
For since each hand hath put on Natures power
Fairing the foul with Arts false borrowed face
Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
But is profaned if not lives in disgrace
Therefore my mistress eyes are raven black
Her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
At such who not born fair no beauty lack
Slandring creation with a false esteem
Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe
That every tongue says beauty should look so
How oft when thou my music music playst
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand
Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
At the woods boldness by thee blushing stand
To be so tickled they would change their state
And situation with those dancing chips
Oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
Making dead wood more blessd than living lips
Since saucy jacks so happy are in this
Give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss
The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
Is lust in action and till action lust
Is perjured murderous bloody full of blame
Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight
Past reason hunted and no sooner had
Past reason hated as a swallowed bait
On purpose laid to make the taker mad
Mad in pursuit and in possession so
Had having and in quest to have extreme
A bliss in proof and proved a very woe
Before a joy proposed behind a dream
All this the world well knows yet none knows well
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun
Coral is far more red than her lips red
If snow be white why then her breasts are dun
If hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
I have seen roses damasked red and white
But no such roses see I in her cheeks
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
I love to hear her speak yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound
I grant I never saw a goddess go
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground
And yet by heaven I think my love as rare
As any she belied with false compare
Thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
For well thou knowst to my dear doting heart
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
Yet in good faith some say that thee behold
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan
To say they err I dare not be so bold
Although I swear it to myself alone
And to be sure that is not false I swear
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face
One on anothers neck do witness bear
Thy black is fairest in my judgments place
In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
And thence this slander as I think proceeds
Thine eyes I love and they as pitying me
Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain
Have put on black and loving mourners be
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
And truly not the morning sun of heaven
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
Nor that full star that ushers in the even
Doth half that glory to the sober west
As those two mourning eyes become thy face
O let it then as well beseem thy heart
To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
And suit thy pity like in every part
Then will I swear beauty herself is black
And all they foul that thy complexion lack
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me
Ist not enough to torture me alone
But slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed
Of him myself and thee I am forsaken
A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed
Prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward
But then my friends heart let my poor heart bail
Whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard
Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail
And yet thou wilt for I being pent in thee
Perforce am thine and all that is in me
So now I have confessed that he is thine
And I my self am mortgaged to thy will
Myself Ill forfeit so that other mine
Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
But thou wilt not nor he will not be free
For thou art covetous and he is kind
He learned but suretylike to write for me
Under that bond that him as fast doth bind
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
Thou usurer that putst forth all to use
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake
So him I lose through my unkind abuse
Him have I lost thou hast both him and me
He pays the whole and yet am I not free
Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy Will
And Will to boot and Will in overplus
More than enough am I that vexed thee still
To thy sweet will making addition thus
Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
Shall will in others seem right gracious
And in my will no fair acceptance shine
The sea all water yet receives rain still
And in abundance addeth to his store
So thou being rich in Will add to thy Will
One will of mine to make thy large will more
Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
Think all but one and me in that one Will
If thy soul check thee that I come so near
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will
And will thy soul knows is admitted there
Thus far for love my lovesuit sweet fulfil
Will will fulfil the treasure of thy love
Ay fill it full with wills and my will one
In things of great receipt with ease we prove
Among a number one is reckoned none
Then in the number let me pass untold
Though in thy stores account I one must be
For nothing hold me so it please thee hold
That nothing me a something sweet to thee
Make but my name thy love and love that still
And then thou lovest me for my name is Will
Thou blind fool Love what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see
They know what beauty is see where it lies
Yet what the best is take the worst to be
If eyes corrupt by overpartial looks
Be anchored in the bay where all men ride
Why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
Why should my heart think that a several plot
Which my heart knows the wide worlds common place
Or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
To put fair truth upon so foul a face
In things right true my heart and eyes have erred
And to this false plague are they now transferred
When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies
That she might think me some untutored youth
Unlearned in the worlds false subtleties
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
Over hill over dale
Thorough bush thorough brier
Over park over pale
Thorough flood thorough fire
I do wander everywhere
Swifter than the moons sphere
And I serve the Fairy Queen
To dew her orbs upon the green
The cowslips tall her pensioners be
In their gold coats spots you see
Those be rubies fairy favours
In those freckles live their savours
I must go seek some dewdrops here
And hang a pearl in every cowslips ear
FROM off a hill whose concave womb reworded
A plaintful story from a sistering vale
My spirits to attend this double voice accorded
And down I laid to list the sadtuned tale
Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale
Tearing of papers breaking rings atwain
Storming her world with sorrows wind and rain
Upon her head a platted hive of straw
Which fortified her visage from the sun
Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
The carcass of beauty spent and done
Time had not scythed all that youth begun
Nor youth all quit but spite of heavens fell rage
Some beauty peepd through lattice of seard age
Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne
Which on it had conceited characters
Laundering the silken figures in the brine
That seasond woe had pelleted in tears
And often reading what contents it bears
As often shrieking undistinguishd woe
In clamours of all size both high and low
Sometimes her levelld eyes their carriage ride
As they did battery to the spheres intend
Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
To the orbed earth sometimes they do extend
Their view right on anon their gazes lend
To every place at once and nowhere fixd
The mind and sight distractedly commixd
Her hair nor loose nor tied in formal plat
Proclaimd in her a careless hand of pride
For some untuckd descended her sheaved hat
Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside
Some in her threaden fillet still did bide
And true to bondage would not break from thence
Though slackly braided in loose negligence
A thousand favours from a maund she drew
Of amber crystal and of beaded jet
Which one by one she in a river threw
Upon whose weeping margent she was set
Like usury applying wet to wet
Or monarchs hands that let not bounty fall
Where want cries some but where excess begs all
Of folded schedules had she many a one
Which she perused sighd tore and gave the flood
Crackd many a ring of posied gold and bone
Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud
Found yet moe letters sadly pennd in blood
With sleided silk feat and affectedly
Enswathed and seald to curious secrecy
These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes
And often kissd and often gan to tear
Cried O false blood thou register of lies
What unapproved witness dost thou bear
Ink would have seemd more black and damned here
This said in top of rage the lines she rents
Big discontent so breaking their contents
A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh
Sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew
Of court of city and had let go by
The swiftest hours observed as they flew
Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew
And privileged by age desires to know
In brief the grounds and motives of her woe
So slides he down upon his grained bat
And comelydistant sits he by her side
When he again desires her being sat
Her grievance with his hearing to divide
If that from him there may be aught applied
Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage
Tis promised in the charity of age
Father she says though in me you behold
The injury of many a blasting hour
Let it not tell your judgment I am old
Not age but sorrow over me hath power
I might as yet have been a spreading flower
Fresh to myself If I had selfapplied
Love to myself and to no love beside
But woe is me too early I attended
A youthful suitit was to gain my grace
Of one by natures outwards so commended
That maidens eyes stuck over all his face
Love lackd a dwelling and made him her place
And when in his fair parts she did abide
She was new lodged and newly deified
His browny locks did hang in crooked curls
And every light occasion of the wind
Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls
Whats sweet to do to do will aptly find
Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind
For on his visage was in little drawn
What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn
Small show of man was yet upon his chin
His phoenix down began but to appear
Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
Whose bare outbraggd the web it seemd to wear
Yet showd his visage by that cost more dear
And nice affections wavering stood in doubt
If best were as it was or best without
His qualities were beauteous as his form
For maidentongued he was and thereof free
Yet if men moved him was he such a storm
As oft twixt May and April is to see
When winds breathe sweet untidy though they be
His rudeness so with his authorized youth
Did livery falseness in a pride of truth
Well could he ride and often men would say
That horse his mettle from his rider takes
Proud of subjection noble by the sway
What rounds what bounds what course what stop
he makes
And controversy hence a question takes
Whether the horse by him became his deed
Or he his manage by the welldoing steed
But quickly on this side the verdict went
His real habitude gave life and grace
To appertainings and to ornament
Accomplishd in himself not in his case
All aids themselves made fairer by their place
Came for additions yet their purposed trim
Pieced not his grace but were all graced by him
So on the tip of his subduing tongue
All kinds of arguments and question deep
All replication prompt and reason strong
For his advantage still did wake and sleep
To make the weeper laugh the laugher weep
He had the dialect and different skill
Catching all passions in his craft of will
That he did in the general bosom reign
Of young of old and sexes both enchanted
To dwell with him in thoughts or to remain
In personal duty following where he haunted
Consents bewitchd ere he desire have granted
And dialogued for him what he would say
Askd their own wills and made their wills obey
Many there were that did his picture get
To serve their eyes and in it put their mind
Like fools that in th imagination set
The goodly objects which abroad they find
Of lands and mansions theirs in thought assignd
And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them
Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them
So many have that never touchd his hand
Sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart
My woeful self that did in freedom stand
And was my own feesimple not in part
What with his art in youth and youth in art
Threw my affections in his charmed power
Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower
Yet did I not as some my equals did
Demand of him nor being desired yielded
Finding myself in honour so forbid
With safest distance I mine honour shielded
Experience for me many bulwarks builded
Of proofs newbleeding which remaind the foil
Of this false jewel and his amorous spoil
But ah who ever shunnd by precedent
The destined ill she must herself assay
Or forced examples gainst her own content
To put the bypast perils in her way
Counsel may stop awhile what will not stay
For when we rage advice is often seen
By blunting us to make our wits more keen
Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood
That we must curb it upon others proof
To be forbod the sweets that seem so good
For fear of harms that preach in our behoof
O appetite from judgment stand aloof
The one a palate hath that needs will taste
Though Reason weep and cry It is thy last
For further I could say This mans untrue
And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling
Heard where his plants in others orchards grew
Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling
Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling
Thought characters and words merely but art
And bastards of his foul adulterate heart
And long upon these terms I held my city
Till thus he gan besiege me Gentle maid
Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity
And be not of my holy vows afraid
Thats to ye sworn to none was ever said
For feasts of love I have been calld unto
Till now did neer invite nor never woo
All my offences that abroad you see
Are errors of the blood none of the mind
Love made them not with acture they may be
Where neither party is nor true nor kind
They sought their shame that so their shame did find
And so much less of shame in me remains
By how much of me their reproach contains
Among the many that mine eyes have seen
Not one whose flame my heart so much as warmd
Or my affection put to the smallest teen
Or any of my leisures ever charmd
Harm have I done to them but neer was harmd
Kept hearts in liveries but mine own was free
And reignd commanding in his monarchy
Look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me
Of paled pearls and rubies red as blood
Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me
Of grief and blushes aptly understood
In bloodless white and the encrimsond mood
Effects of terror and dear modesty
Encampd in hearts but fighting outwardly
And lo behold these talents of their hair
With twisted metal amorously impleachd
I have received from many a several fair
Their kind acceptance weepingly beseechd
With the annexions of fair gems enrichd
And deepbraind sonnets that did amplify
Each stones dear nature worth and quality
The diamondwhy twas beautiful and hard
Whereto his invised properties did tend
The deepgreen emerald in whose fresh regard
Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend
The heavenhued sapphire and the opal blend
With objects manifold each several stone
With wit well blazond smiled or made some moan
Lo all these trophies of affections hot
Of pensived and subdued desires the tender
Nature hath charged me that I hoard them not
But yield them up where I myself must render
That is to you my origin and ender
For these of force must your oblations be
Since I their altar you enpatron me
O then advance of yours that phraseless hand
Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise
Take all these similes to your own command
Hallowd with sighs that burning lungs did raise
What me your minister for you obeys
Works under you and to your audit comes
Their distract parcels in combined sums
Lo this device was sent me from a nun
Or sister sanctified of holiest note
Which late her noble suit in court did shun
Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote
For she was sought by spirits of richest coat
But kept cold distance and did thence remove
To spend her living in eternal love
But O my sweet what labour ist to leave
The thing we have not mastering what not strives
Playing the place which did no form receive
Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves
She that her fame so to herself contrives
The scars of battle scapeth by the flight
And makes her absence valiant not her might
O pardon me in that my boast is true
The accident which brought me to her eye
Upon the moment did her force subdue
And now she would the caged cloister fly
Religious love put out Religions eye
Not to be tempted would she be immured
And now to tempt all liberty procured
How mighty then you are O hear me tell
The broken bosoms that to me belong
Have emptied all their fountains in my well
And mine I pour your ocean all among
I strong oer them and you oer me being strong
Must for your victory us all congest
As compound love to physic your cold breast
My parts had power to charm a sacred nun
Who disciplined ay dieted in grace
Believed her eyes when they to assail begun
All vows and consecrations giving place
O most potential love vow bond nor space
In thee hath neither sting knot nor confine
For thou art all and all things else are thine
When thou impressest what are precepts worth
Of stale example When thou wilt inflame
How coldly those impediments stand forth
Of wealth of filial fear law kindred fame
Loves arms are peace gainst rule gainst sense
gainst shame
And sweetens in the suffering pangs it bears
The aloes of all forces shocks and fears
Now all these hearts that do on mine depend
Feeling it break with bleeding groans they pine
And supplicant their sighs to you extend
To leave the battery that you make gainst mine
Lending soft audience to my sweet design
And credent soul to that strongbonded oath
That shall prefer and undertake my troth
This said his watery eyes he did dismount
Whose sights till then were levelld on my face
Each cheek a river running from a fount
With brinish current downward flowd apace
O how the channel to the stream gave grace
Who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses
That flame through water which their hue encloses
O father what a hell of witchcraft lies
In the small orb of one particular tear
But with the inundation of the eyes
What rocky heart to water will not wear
What breast so cold that is not warmed here
O cleft effect cold modesty hot wrath
Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath
For lo his passion but an art of craft
Even there resolved my reason into tears
There my white stole of chastity I daffd
Shook off my sober guards and civil fears
Appear to him as he to me appears
All melting though our drops this difference bore
His poisond me and mine did him restore
In him a plenitude of subtle matter
Applied to cautels all strange forms receives
Of burning blushes or of weeping water
Or swooning paleness and he takes and leaves
In eithers aptness as it best deceives
To blush at speeches rank to weep at woes
Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows
That not a heart which in his level came
Could scape the hail of his allhurting aim
Showing fair nature is both kind and tame
And veild in them did win whom he would maim
Against the thing he sought he would exclaim
When he most burnd in heartwishd luxury
He preachd pure maid and praised cold chastity
Thus merely with the garment of a Grace
The naked and concealed fiend he coverd
That th unexperient gave the tempter place
Which like a cherubin above them hoverd
Who young and simple would not be so loverd
Ay me I fell and yet do question make
What I should do again for such a sake
O that infected moisture of his eye
O that false fire which in his cheek so glowd
O that forced thunder from his heart did fly
O that sad breath his spongy lungs bestowd
O all that borrowd motion seeming owed
Would yet again betray the forebetrayd
And new pervert a reconciled maid
Crabbed Age and Youth
Cannot live together
Youth is full of pleasance
Age is full of care
Youth like summer morn
Age like winter weather
Youth like summer brave
Age like winter bare
Youth is full of sports
Ages breath is short
Youth is nimble Age is lame
Youth is hot and bold
Age is weak and cold
Youth is wild and Age is tame
Age I do abhor thee
Youth I do adore thee
O my Love my Love is young
Age I do defy thee
O sweet shepherd hie thee
For methinks thou stayst too long
All the worlds a stage
And all the men and women merely players
They have their exits and their entrances
And one man in his time plays many parts
His acts being seven ages At first the infant
Mewling and puking in the nurses arms
Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel
And shining morning face creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school And then the lover
Sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress eyebrow Then a soldier
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard
Jealous in honor sudden and quick in quarrel
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannons mouth And then the justice
In fair round belly with good capon lined
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut
Full of wise saws and modern instances
And so he plays his part The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side
His youthful hose well saved a world too wide
For his shrunk shank and his big manly voice
Turning again toward childish treble pipes
And whistles in his sound Last scene of all
That ends this strange eventful history
Is second childishness and mere oblivion
Sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything
Enobarbus describes Queen Cleopatra
Enobarbus I will tell you
The barge she sat in like a burnishd throne
Burned on the water the poop was beaten gold
Purple the sails and so perfumed that
The winds were lovesick with them the oars were silver
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made
The water which they beat to follow faster
As amorous of their strokes For her own person
It beggard all description she did lie
In her pavilion clothofgold of tissue
Oerpicturing that Venus where we see
The fancy outwork nature on each side her
Stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling Cupids
With diverscolourd fans whose wind did seem
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool
And what they undid did
Agrippa O rare for Antony
Enobarbus Her gentlewomen like the Nereides
So many mermaids tended her i th eyes
And made their bends adornings At the helm
A seeming mermaid steers the silken tackle
Swell with the touches of those flowersoft hands
That yarely frame the office From the barge
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
Of the adjacent wharfs The city cast
Her people out upon her and Antony
Enthroned i th marketplace did sit alone
Whistling to th air which but for vacancy
Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too
And made a gap in nature
Agrippa Rare Egyptian
Enobarbus Upon her landing Antony sent to her
Invited her to supper She replied
It should be better he became her guest
Which she entreated Our courteous Antony
Whom neer the word of No woman heard speak
Being barbered ten times oer goes to the feast
And for his ordinary pays his heart
For what his eyes eat only
Agrippa Royal wench
She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed
He plowed her and she cropped
Enobarbus I saw her once
Hop forty paces through the public street
And having lost her breath she spoke and panted
That she did make defect perfection
And breathless powr breathe forth
Maecenas Now Antony must leave her utterly
Enobarbus Never He will not
Age cannot wither her nor custom stale
Her infinite variety Other women cloy
The appetites they feed but she makes hungry
Where most she satisfies for vilest things
Become themselves in her that the holy priests
Bless her when she is riggish
HARK hark the lark at heavens gate sings
And Phoebus gins arise
His steeds to water at those springs
On chaliced flowers that lies
And winking Marybuds begin
To ope their golden eyes
With everything that pretty bin
My lady sweet arise
Arise arise
Blow blow thou winter wind
Thou art not so unkind
As mans ingratitude
Thy tooth is not so keen
Because thou art not seen
Although thy breath be rude
Heighho sing heighho unto the green holly
Most freindship if feigning most loving mere folly
Then heighho the holly
This life is most jolly
Freeze freeze thou bitter sky
That does not bite so nigh
As benefits forgot
Though thou the waters warp
Thy sting is not so sharp
As a friend remembered not
Heighho sing heighho unto the green holly
Most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly
Then heighho the holly
This life is most jolly
ROSES their sharp spines being gone
Not royal in their smells alone
But in their hue
Maiden pinks of odour faint
Daisies smellless yet most quaint
And sweet thyme true
Primrose firstborn child of Ver
Merry springtimes harbinger
With her bells dim
Oxlips in their cradles growing
Marigolds on deathbeds blowing
Larksheels trim
All dear Natures children sweet
Lie fore bride and bridegrooms feet
Blessing their sense
Not an angel of the air
Bird melodious or bird fair
Be absent hence
The crow the slanderous cuckoo nor
The boding raven nor chough hoar
Nor chattering pye
May on our bridehouse perch or sing
Or with them any discord bring
But from it fly
URNS and odours bring away
Vapours sighs darken the day
Our dole more deadly looks than dying
Balms and gums and heavy cheers
Sacred vials filld with tears
And clamours through the wild air flying
Come all sad and solemn shows
That are quickeyed Pleasures foes
We convent naught else but woes
COME away come away death
And in sad cypres let me be laid
Fly away fly away breath
I am slain by a fair cruel maid
My shroud of white stuck all with yew
O prepare it
My part of death no one so true
Did share it
Not a flower not a flower sweet
On my black coffin let there be strown
Not a friend not a friend greet
My poor corse where my bones shall be thrown
A thousand thousand sighs to save
Lay me O where
Sad true lover never find my grave
To weep there
OVER hill over dale
Thorough bush thorough brier
Over park over pale
Thorough flood thorough fire
I do wander everywhere
Swifter than the moones sphere
And I serve the fairy queen
To dew her orbs upon the green
The cowslips tall her pensioners be
In their gold coats spots you see
Those be rubies fairy favours
In those freckles live their savours
I must go seek some dewdrops here
And hang a pearl in every cowslips ear
YOU spotted snakes with double tongue
Thorny hedgehogs be not seen
Newts and blindworms do no wrong
Come not near our fairy queen
Philomel with melody
Sing in our sweet lullaby
Lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby
Never harm
Nor spell nor charm
Come our lovely lady nigh
So good night with lullaby
Weaving spiders come not here
Hence you longleggd spinners hence
Beetles black approach not near
Worm nor snail do no offence
Philomel with melody
Sing in our sweet lullaby
Lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby
Never harm
Nor spell nor charm
Come our lovely lady nigh
So good night with lullaby
COME unto these yellow sands
And then take hands
Courtsied when you have and kissd
The wild waves whist
Foot it featly here and there
And sweet sprites the burthen bear
Hark hark
Bow wow
The watchdogs bark
Bow wow
Hark hark I hear
The strain of strutting chanticleer
Cry Cockadiddledow
Fear no more the heat o the sun
Nor the furious winters rages
Thou thy worldly task hast done
Home art gone and taen thy wages
Golden lads and girls all must
As chimney sweepers come to dust
Fear no more the frown of the great
Thou art past the tyrants stroke
Care no more to clothe and eat
To thee the reed is as the oak
The sceptre learning physic must
All follow this and come to dust
Fear no more the lightningflash
Nor the alldread thunderstone
Fear not slander censure rash
Thou hast finished joy and moan
All lovers young all lovers must
Consign to thee and come to dust
No exorciser harm thee
Nor no witchcraft charm thee
Ghost unlaid forbear thee
Nothing ill come near thee
Quiet consummation have
And renowned be thy grave
Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under
Cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss
Who therefore angry seems to part in sunder
Swelling on either side to want his bliss
Between whose hills her head entombed is
Where like a virtuous monument she lies
To be admired of lewd unhallowed eyes
Without the bed her other fair hand was
On the green coverlet whose perfect white
Showed like an April daisy on the grass
With pearly sweat resembling dew of night
Her eyes like marigolds had sheathed their light
And canopied in darkness sweetly lay
Till they might open to adorn the day
Her hair like golden threads played with her breath
O modest wantons wanton modesty
Showing lifes triumph in the map of death
And deaths dim look in lifes mortality
Each in her sleep themselves so beautify
As if between them twain there were no strife
But that life lived in death and death in life
Her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue
A pair of maiden worlds unconquered
Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew
And him by oath they truly honoured
These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred
Who like a foul usurper went about
From this fair throne to heave the owner out
What could he see but mightily he noted
What did he note but strongly he desired
What he beheld on that he firmly doted
And in his will his willful eye he tired
With more than admiration he admired
Her azure veins her alabaster skin
Her coral lips her snowwhite dimpled chin
As the grim lion fawneth oer his prey
Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied
So oer this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay
His rage of lust by gazing qualified
Slacked not suppressed for standing by her side
His eye which late this mutiny restrains
Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins
And they like straggling slaves for pillage fighting
Obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting
In bloody death and ravishment delighting
Nor childrens tears nor mothers groans respecting
Swell in their pride the onset still expecting
Anon his beating heart alarum striking
Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking
His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye
His eye commends the leading to his hand
His hand as proud of such a dignity
Smoking with pride marched on to make his stand
On her bare breast the heart of all her land
Whose ranks of blue veins as his hand did scale
Left their round turrets destitute and pale
They mustering to the quiet cabinet
Where their dear governess and lady lies
Do tell her she is dreadfully beset
And fright her with confusion of their cries
She much amazed breaks ope her lockedup eyes
Who peeping forth this tumult to behold
Are by his flaming torch dimmed and controlled
Imagine her as one in dead of night
From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking
That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite
Whose grim aspect sets every joint ashaking
What terror it is but she in worser taking
From sleep disturbed heedfully doth view
The sight which makes supposed terror true
Wrapped and confounded in a thousand fears
Like to a newkilled bird she trembling lies
She dares not look yet winking there appears
Quickshifting antics ugly in her eyes
Such shadows are the weak brains forgeries
Who angry that the eyes fly from their lights
In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights
His hand that yet remains upon her breast
Rude ram to batter such an ivory wall
May feel her heart poor citizen distressed
Wounding itself to death rise up and fall
Beating her bulk that his hand shakes withal
This moves in him more rage and lesser pity
To make the breach and enter this sweet city
But lo from forth a copse that neighbours by
A breeding jennet lusty young and proud
Adonis trampling courser doth espy
And forth she rushes snorts and neighs aloud
The strongneckd steed being tied unto a tree
Breaketh his rein and to her straight goes he
Imperiously he leaps he neighs he bounds
And now his woven girths he breaks asunder
The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds
Whose hollow womb resounds like heavens thunder
The iron bit he crushes tween his teeth
Controlling what he was controlled with
His ears upprickd his braided hanging mane
Upon his compassd crest now stand on end
His nostrils drink the air and forth again
As from a furnace vapours doth he send
His eye which scornfully glisters like fire
Shows his hot courage and his high desire
Sometime her trots as if he told the steps
With gentle majesty and modest pride
Anon he rears upright curvets and leaps
As who should say Lo thus my strength is tried
And this I do to captivate the eye
Of the fair breeder that is standing by
What recketh he his riders angry stir
His flattering Holla or his Stand I say
What cares he now for curb of pricking spur
For rich caparisons or trapping gay
He sees his love and nothing else he sees
Nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees
Look when a painter would surpass the life
In limning out a wellproportiond steed
His art with natures workmanship at strife
As if the dead the living should exceed
So did this horse excel a common one
In shape in courage colour pace and bone
Roundhoofd shortjointed fetlocks shag and long
Broad breast full eye small head and nostril wide
High crest short ears straight legs and passing strong
Thin mane thick tail broad buttock tender hide
Look what a horse should have he did not lack
Save a proud rider on so proud a back
Sometimes he scuds far off and there he stares
Anon he starts at stirring of a feather
To bid the wind a race he now prepares
And wher he run or fly they know not whether
For through his mane and tail the high wind sings
Fanning the hairs who wave like featherd wings
He looks upon his love and neighs unto her
She answers him as if she knew his mind
Being proud as females are to see him woo her
She puts on outward strangeness seems unkind
Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels
Beating his kind embracements with her heels
Then like a melancholy malcontent
He vails his tail that like a falling plume
Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent
He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume
His love perceiving how he is enragd
Grew kinder and his fury was assuagd
His testy master goeth about to take him
When lo the unbackd breeder full of fear
Jealous of catching swiftly doth forsake him
With her the horse and left Adonis there
As they were mad unto the wood they hie them
Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them
I prophesy they death my living sorrow
If thou encounter with the boar tomorrow
But if thou needs wilt hunt be ruld by me
Uncouple at the timorous flying hare
Or at the fox which lives by subtlety
Or at the roe which no encounter dare
Pursue these fearful creatures oer the downs
And on they wellbreathd horse keep with they hounds
And when thou hast on food the purblind hare
Mark the poor wretch to overshoot his troubles
How he outruns with winds and with what care
He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles
The many musits through the which he goes
Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes
Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep
To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell
And sometime where earthdelving conies keep
To stop the loud pursuers in their yell
And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer
Danger deviseth shifts wit waits on fear
For there his smell with other being mingled
The hot scentsnuffing hounds are driven to doubt
Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
With much ado the cold fault cleanly out
Then do they spend their mouths Echo replies
As if another chase were in the skies
By this poor Wat far off upon a hill
Stands on his hinder legs with listening ear
To hearken if his foes pursue him still
Anon their loud alarums he doth hear
And now his grief may be compared well
To one sore sick that hears the passingbell
Then shalt thou see the dewbedabbled wretch
Turn and return indenting with the way
Each envious briar his weary legs doth scratch
Each shadow makes him stop each murmur stay
For misery is trodden on by many
And being low never relievd by any
Lie quietly and hear a little more
Nay do not struggle for thou shalt not rise
To make thee hate the hunting of the boar
Unlike myself thou hearst me moralize
Applying this to that and so to so
For love can comment upon every woe
Full fathom five thy father lies
Of his bones are coral made
Those are pearls that were his eyes
Nothing of him that doth fade
But doth suffer a seachange
Into something rich and strange
Seanymphs hourly ring his knell
Dingdong
Hark now I hear themdingdong bell
Hark hark the lark at heavens gate sings
And Phoebus gins arise
His steeds to water at those springs
On chalicd flowers that lies
And winking Marybuds begin
To ope their golden eyes
With everything that pretty is
My lady sweet arise
Arise arise
Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie
Which we ascribe to heaven The fated sky
Gives us free scope only doth backward pull
Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull
What power is it which mounts my love so high
That makes me see and cannot feed mine eye
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
To join like likes and kiss like native things
Impossible be strange attempts to those
That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
What hath been cannot be Who ever strove
To show her merit that did miss her love
IT was a lover and his lass
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
That oer the green cornfield did pass
In the spring time the only pretty ring time
When birds do sing hey ding a ding ding
Sweet lovers love the spring
Between the acres of the rye
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
These pretty country folks would lie
In the spring time the only pretty ring time
When birds do sing hey ding a ding ding
Sweet lovers love the spring
This carol they began that hour
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
How that life was but a flower
In the spring time the only pretty ring time
When birds do sing hey ding a ding ding
Sweet lovers love the spring
And therefore take the present time
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
For love is crowngraved with the prime
In the spring time the only pretty ring time
When birds do sing hey ding a ding ding
Sweet lovers love the spring
FarewellGod knows when we shall meet again
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
That almost freezes up the heat of life
Ill call them back again to comfort me
NurseWhat should she do here
My dismal scene I needs must act alone
Come vial
What if this mixture do not work at all
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning
No Nothis shall forbid itlie thou there
What if it be a poison which the friar
Subtly hath ministerd to have me dead
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonourd
Because he married me before to Romeo
I fear it is and yet methinks it should not
For he hath still been tried a holy man
I will not entertain so bad a thought
How if when I am laid into the tomb
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me theres a fearful point
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes
Or if I live is it not very like
The horrible conceit of death and night
Together with the terror of the place
As in a vault an ancient receptacle
Where for this many hundred years the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are packd
Where bloody Tybalt yet but green in earth
Lies festering in his shroud where as they say
At some hours in the night spirits resort
Alack alack is it not like that I
So early wakingwhat with loathsome smells
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth
That living mortals hearing them run mad
O if I wake shall I not be distraught
Environed with all these hideous fears
And madly play with my forefathers joints
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud
And in this rage with some great kinsmans bone
As with a club dash out my desperate brains
O look methinks I see my cousins ghost
Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body
Upon a rapiers pointstay Tybalt stay
Romeo I come this do I drink to thee
TELL me where is Fancy bred
Or in the heart or in the head
How begot how nourished
Reply reply
It is engenderd in the eyes
With gazing fed and Fancy dies
In the cradle where it lies
Let us all ring Fancys knell
Ill begin itDing dong bell
All Ding dong bell
Three witches casting a spell
Round about the cauldron go
In the poisond entrails throw
Toad that under cold stone
Days and nights hast thirty one
Swelterd venom sleeping got
Boil thou first i the charmed pot
Double double toil and trouble
Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Fillet of a fenny snake
In the cauldron boil and bake
Eye of newt and toe of frog
Wool of bat and tongue of dog
Adders fork and blindworms sting
Lizards leg and howlets wing
For a charm of powerful trouble
Like a hellbroth boil and bubble
Double double toil and trouble
Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck
And yet methinks I have astronomy
But not to tell of good or evil luck
Of plagues of dearths or seasons quality
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell
Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
Or say with princes if it shall go well
By oft predict that I in heaven find
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive
And constant stars in them I read such art
As truth and beauty shall together thrive
If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert
Or else of thee this I prognosticate
Thy end is truths and beautys doom and date
Not marble nor the gilded monuments
Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Than unswept stone besmeard with sluttish time
When wasteful war shall statues overturn
And broils root out the work of masonry
Nor Mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn
The living record of your memory
Gainst death and alloblivious enmity
Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
Even in the eyes of all posterity
That wear this world out to the ending doom
So till the judgment that yourself arise
You live in this and dwell in lovers eyes
Now my comates and brothers in exile
Hath not old customs make this life more sweet
Than that of painted pomp Are not these woods
More free from peril than the envious court
Here feel we not the penalty of Adam
The seasons difference as the icy fang
And churlish chiding of the winters wind
Which when it bites and blows upon my body
Even till I shrink with cold I smile and say
This is no flattery these are counsellors
That feelingly persuade me what I am
Sweet are the uses of adversity
Which like the toad ugly and venomous
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head
And this our life exempt from public haunt
Finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks
Sermons in stones and good in everything
I would not change it
PUCK sings
NOW the hungry lion roars
And the wolf behowls the moon
Whilst the heavy ploughman snores
All with weary task fordone
Now the wasted brands do glow
Whilst the screechowl screeching loud
Puts the wretch that lies in woe
In remembrance of a shroud
Now it is the time of night
That the graves all gaping wide
Every one lets forth his sprite
In the churchway paths to glide
And we fairies that do run
By the triple Hecates team
From the presence of the sun
Following darkness like a dream
Now are frolic not a mouse
Shall disturb this hallowed house
I am sent with broom before
To sweep the dust behind the door
O mistress mine where are you roaming
O stay and hear your trueloves coming
That can sing both high and low
Trip no further pretty sweeting
Journeys end in lovers meeting
Every wise mans son doth know
What is love tis not hereafter
Present mirth hath present laughter
Whats to come is still unsure
In delay there lies no plenty
Then come kiss me Sweet and twenty
Youths a stuff will not endure
O never say that I was false of heart
Though absence seemd my flame to qualify
As easy might I from myself depart
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
That is my home of love if I have ranged
Like him that travels I return again
Just to the time not with the time exchanged
So that myself bring water for my stain
Never believe though in my nature reignd
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
That it could so preposterously be staind
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good
For nothing this wide universe I call
Save thou my rose in it thou art my all
Orpheus with his lute made trees
And the mountain tops that freeze
Bow themselves when he did sing
To his music plants and flowers
Ever sprung as sun and showers
There had made a lasting spring
Everything that heard him play
Even the billows of the sea
Hung their heads and then lay by
In sweet music is such art
Killing care and grief of heart
Fall asleep or hearing die
or John Fletcher
ORPHEUS with his lute made trees
And the mountain tops that freeze
Bow themselves when he did sing
To his music plants and flowers
Ever sprung as sun and showers
There had made a lasting spring
Every thing that heard him play
Even the billows of the sea
Hung their heads and then lay by
In sweet music is such art
Killing care and grief of heart
Fall asleep or hearing die
Shall I compare thee to a summers day
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
And summers lease hath all too short a date
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
And often is his gold complexion dimmed
And every fair from fair sometime declines
By chance or natures changing course untrimmed
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owst
Nor shall death brag thou wandrest in his shade
When in eternal lines to Time thou growst
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see
So long lives this and this gives life to thee
Sigh no more ladies sigh no more
Men were deceivers ever
One foot in sea and one on shore
To one thing constant never
Then sigh not so
But let them go
And be you blith and bonny
Converting all your sounds of woe
Into Hey nonny nonny
Sing no more ditties sing no mo
Of dumps so dull and heavy
The fraud of men was ever so
Since summer first was leavy
Then sigh not so
But let them go
And be you blith and bonny
Converting all your sounds of woe
Into Hey nonny nonny
WHO is Silvia What is she
That all our swains commend her
Holy fair and wise is she
The heaven such grace did lend her
That she might admired be
Is she kind as she is fair
For beauty lives with kindness
Love doth to her eyes repair
To help him of his blindness
And being helpd inhabits there
Then to Silvia let us sing
That Silvia is excelling
She excels each mortal thing
Upon the dull earth dwelling
To her let us garlands bring
Marcellus to Horatio and Bernardo after seeing the Ghost
Some say that ever against that season comes
Wherein our Saviours birth is celebrated
This bird of dawning singeth all night long
And then they say no spirit dare stir abroad
The nights are wholesome then no planets strike
No fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm
So hallowd and so gracious is the time
O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give
The rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
For that sweet odour which doth in it live
The cankerblooms have full as deep a dye
As the perfumed tincture of the roses
Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
When summers breath their masked buds discloses
But for their virtue only is their show
They live unwood and unrespected fade
Die to themselves Sweet roses do not so
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
And so of you beauteous and lovely youth
When that shall fade my verse distills your truth
Double double toil and trouble
Fire burn and caldron bubble
Fillet of a fenny snake
In the caldron boil and bake
Eye of newt and toe of frog
Wool of bat and tongue of dog
Adders fork and blindworms sting
Lizards leg and howlets wing
For a charm of powerful trouble
Like a hellbroth boil and bubble
Double double toil and trouble
Fire burn and caldron bubble
Cool it with a baboons blood
Then the charm is firm and good
From fairest creatures we desire increase
That thereby beautys rose might never die
But as the riper should by time decease
His tender heir might bear his memory
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
Feedst thy lightst flame with selfsubstantial fuel
Making a famine where abundance lies
Thyself thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
Thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
And tender churl makest waste in niggarding
Pity the world or else this glutton be
To eat the worlds due by the grave and thee
From fairest creatures we desire increase
That thereby beautys rose might never die
But as the riper should by time decease
His tender heir might bear his memory
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
Feedst thy lights flame with selfsubstantial fuel
Making a famine where abundance lies
Thyself thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
Thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
And tender churl makst waste in niggarding
Pity the world or else this glutton be
To eat the worlds due by the grave and thee
For shame deny that thou bearst love to any
Who for thy self art so unprovident
Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
But that thou none lovst is most evident
For thou art so possessed with murdrous hate
That gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Which to repair should be thy chief desire
O change thy thought that I may change my mind
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
Be as thy presence is gracious and kind
Or to thy self at least kindhearted prove
Make thee another self for love of me
That beauty still may live in thine or thee
Where art thou Muse that thou forgetst so long
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might
Spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
Return forgetful Muse and straight redeem
In gentle numbers time so idly spent
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
And gives thy pen both skill and argument
Rise resty Muse my loves sweet face survey
If time have any wrinkle graven there
If any be a satire to decay
And make times spoils despised everywhere
Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life
So thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife
O truant Muse what shall be thy amends
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed
Both truth and beauty on my love depends
So dost thou too and therein dignified
Make answer Muse Wilt thou not haply say
Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed
Beauty no pencil beautys truth to lay
But best is best if never intermixed
Because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb
Excuse not silence so fort lies in thee
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
And to be praised of ages yet to be
Then do thy office Muse I teach thee how
To make him seem long hence as he shows now
My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming
I love not less though less the show appear
That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
The owners tongue doth publish everywhere
Our love was new and then but in the spring
When I was wont to greet it with my lays
As Philomel in summers front doth sing
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days
Not that the summer is less pleasant now
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
But that wild music burthens every bough
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight
Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue
Because I would not dull you with my song
Alack what poverty my Muse brings forth
That having such a scope to show her pride
The argument all bare is of more worth
Than when it hath my added praise beside
O blame me not if I no more can write
Look in your glass and there appears a face
That overgoes my blunt invention quite
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
Were it not sinful then striving to mend
To mar the subject that before was well
For to no other pass my verses tend
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell
And more much more than in my verse can sit
Your own glass shows you when you look in it
To me fair friend you never can be old
For as you were when first your eye I eyd
Such seems your beauty still Three winters cold
Have from the forests shook three summers pride
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turnd
In process of the seasons have I seen
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burnd
Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green
Ah yet doth beauty like a dialhand
Steal from his figure and no pace perceivd
So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceivd
For fear of which hear this thou age unbred
Ere you were born was beautys summer dead
Let not my love be called idolatry
Nor my beloved as an idol show
Since all alike my songs and praises be
To one of one still such and ever so
Kind is my love today tomorrow kind
Still constant in a wondrous excellence
Therefore my verse to constancy confined
One thing expressing leaves out difference
Fair kind and true is all my argument
Fair kind and true varying to other words
And in this change is my invention spent
Three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
Fair kind and true have often lived alone
Which three till now never kept seat in one
When in the chronicle of wasted time
I see descriptions of the fairest wights
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
Then in the blazon of sweet beautys best
Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
I see their antique pen would have expressed
Even such a beauty as you master now
So all their praises are but prophecies
Of this our time all you prefiguring
And for they looked but with divining eyes
They had not skill enough your worth to sing
For we which now behold these present days
Have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise
Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come
Can yet the lease of my true love control
Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
And the sad augurs mock their own presage
Incertainties now crown themselves assured
And peace proclaims olives of endless age
Now with the drops of this most balmy time
My love looks fresh and Death to me subscribes
Since spite of him Ill live in this poor rhyme
While he insults oer dull and speechless tribes
And thou in this shalt find thy monument
When tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent
Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come
Can yet the lease of my true love control
Supposd as forfeit to a confind doom
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endurd
And the sad augurs mock their own presage
Incertainties now crown themselves assurd
And peace proclaims olives of endless age
Now with the drops of this most balmy time
My love looks fresh and Death to me subscribes
Since spite of him Ill live in this poor rhyme
While he insults oer dull and speechless tribes
And thou in this shalt find thy monument
When tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent
Whats in the brain that ink may character
Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit
Whats new to speak what now to register
That may express my love or thy dear merit
Nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine
I must each day say oer the very same
Counting no old thing oldthou mine I thine
Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name
So that eternal love in loves fresh case
Weighs not the dust and injury of age
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place
But makes antiquity for aye his page
Finding the first conceit of love there bred
Where time and outward form would show it dead
O never say that I was false of heart
Though absence seemed my flame to qualify
As easy might I from my self depart
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
That is my home of love if I have ranged
Like him that travels I return again
Just to the time not with the time exchanged
So that myself bring water for my stain
Never believe though in my nature reigned
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
That it could so preposterously be stained
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good
For nothing this wide universe I call
Save thou my rose in it thou art my all
As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growst
In one of thine from that which thou departest
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
Herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
Without this folly age and cold decay
If all were minded so the times should cease
And threescore year would make the world away
Let those whom Nature hath not made for store
Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
Look whom she best endowed she gave the more
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
She carved thee for her seal and meant thereby
Thou shouldst print more not let that copy die
Alas tis true I have gone here and there
And made myself a motley to the view
Gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear
Made old offences of affections new
Most true it is that I have looked on truth
Askance and strangely But by all above
These blenches gave my heart another youth
And worse essays proved thee my best of love
Now all is done have what shall have no end
Mine appetite I never more will grind
On newer proof to try an older friend
A god in love to whom I am confined
Then give me welcome next my heaven the best
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast
O for my sake do you with Fortune chide
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
That did not better for my life provide
Than public means which public manners breeds
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand
And almost thence my nature is subdued
To what it works in like the dyers hand
Pity me then and wish I were renewed
Whilst like a willing patient I will drink
Potions of eisel gainst my strong infection
No bitterness that I will bitter think
Nor double penance to correct correction
Pity me then dear friend and I assure ye
Even that your pity is enough to cure me
Your love and pity doth th impression fill
Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow
For what care I who calls me well or ill
So you oergreen my bad my good allow
You are my all the world and I must strive
To know my shames and praises from your tongue
None else to me nor I to none alive
That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong
In so profound abysm I throw all care
Of others voices that my adders sense
To critic and to flatterer stopped are
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense
You are so strongly in my purpose bred
That all the world besides methinks are dead
Since I left you mine eye is in my mind
And that which governs me to go about
Doth part his function and is partly blind
Seems seeing but effectually is out
For it no form delivers to the heart
Of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch
For if it see the rudst or gentlest sight
The most sweetfavour or deformedst creature
The mountain or the sea the day or night
The crow or dove it shapes them to your feature
Incapable of more replete with you
My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue
Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
Drink up the monarchs plague this flattery
Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true
And that your love taught it this alchemy
To make of monsters and things indigest
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble
Creating every bad a perfect best
As fast as objects to his beams assemble
O tis the first tis flattery in my seeing
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing
And to his palate doth prepare the cup
If it be poisoned tis the lesser sin
That mine eye loves it and doth first begin
Those lines that I before have writ do lie
Even those that said I could not love you dearer
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
But reckoning Time whose millioned accidents
Creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings
Tan sacred beauty blunt the sharpst intents
Divert strong minds to the course of altring things
Alas why fearing of Times tyranny
Might I not then say Now I love you best
When I was certain oer incertainty
Crowning the present doubting of the rest
Love is a babe then might I not say so
To give full growth to that which still doth grow
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds
Or bends with the remover to remove
O no it is an everfixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken
It is the star to every wandring bark
Whose worths unknown although his height be taken
Loves not Times fool though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickles compass come
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
But bears it out even to the edge of doom
If this be error and upon me proved
I never writ nor no man ever loved
Like as to make our appetite more keen
With eager compounds we our palate urge
As to prevent our maladies unseen
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge
Even so being full of your neercloying sweetness
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding
And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
To be diseased ere that there was true needing
Thus policy in love t anticipate
The ills that were not grew to faults assured
And brought to medicine a healthful state
Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured
But thence I learn and find the lesson true
Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you
What potions have I drunk of Siren tears
Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within
Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears
Still losing when I saw my self to win
What wretched errors hath my heart committed
Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
In the distraction of this madding fever
O benefit of ill now I find true
That better is by evil still made better
And ruined love when it is built anew
Grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
So I return rebuked to my content
And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent
When I do count the clock that tells the time
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night
When I behold the violet past prime
And sable curls all silvered oer with white
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
And summers green all girded up in sheaves
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
Then of thy beauty do I question make
That thou among the wastes of time must go
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
And die as fast as they see others grow
And nothing gainst Times scythe can make defence
Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence
That you were once unkind befriends me now
And for that sorrow which I then did feel
Needs must I under my transgression bow
Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel
For if you were by my unkindness shaken
As I by yours yhave passed a hell of time
And I a tyrant have no leisure taken
To weigh how once I suffered in your crime
O that our night of woe might have remembered
My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
And soon to you as you to me then tendered
The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits
But that your trespass now becomes a fee
Mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me
Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed
When not to be receives reproach of being
And the just pleasure lost which is so deemed
Not by our feeling but by others seeing
For why should others false adulterate eyes
Give salutation to my sportive blood
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies
Which in their wills count bad what I think good
No I am that I am and they that level
At my abuses reckon up their own
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel
By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown
Unless this general evil they maintain
All men are bad and in their badness reign
Thy gift thy tables are within my brain
Full charactered with lasting memory
Which shall above that idle rank remain
Beyond all date even to eternity
Or at the least so long as brain and heart
Have faculty by nature to subsist
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
Of thee thy record never can be missed
That poor retention could not so much hold
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score
Therefore to give them from me was I bold
To trust those tables that receive thee more
To keep an adjunct to remember thee
Were to import forgetfulness in me
No Time thou shalt not boast that I do change
Thy pyramids built up with newer might
To me are nothing novel nothing strange
They are but dressings of a former sight
Our dates are brief and therefore we admire
What thou dost foist upon us that is old
And rather make them born to our desire
Than think that we before have heard them told
Thy registers and thee I both defy
Not wondring at the present nor the past
For thy records and what we see doth lie
Made more or less by thy continual haste
This I do vow and this shall ever be
I will be true despite thy scythe and thee
Weret aught to me I bore the canopy
With my extern the outward honouring
Or laid great bases for eternity
Which proves more short than waste or ruining
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
Lose all and more by paying too much rent
For compound sweet forgoing simple savour
Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
No let me be obsequious in thy heart
And take thou my oblation poor but free
Which is not mixed with seconds knows no art
But mutual render only me for thee
Hence thou suborned informer a true soul
When most impeached stands least in thy control
O thou my lovely boy who in thy power
Dost hold Times fickle glass his fickle hour
Who hast by waning grown and therein showst
Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self growst
If Nature sovereign mistress over wrack
As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back
She keeps thee to this purpose that her skill
May Time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure
She may detain but not still keep her treasure
Her audit though delayed answered must be
And her quietus is to render thee
How oft when thou my music music playst
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand
Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
At the woods boldness by thee blushing stand
To be so tickled they would change their state
And situation with those dancing chips
Oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
Making dead wood more blest than living lips
Since saucy jacks so happy are in this
Give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss
Th expense of spirit in a waste of shame
Is lust in action and till action lust
Is perjured murderous bloody full of blame
Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight
Past reason hunted and no sooner had
Past reason hated as a swallowed bait
On purpose laid to make the taker mad
Mad in pursuit and in possession so
Had having and in quest to have extreme
A bliss in proof and proved a very woe
Before a joy proposed behind a dream
All this the world well knows yet none knows well
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
O that you were your self But love you are
No longer yours than you yourself here live
Against this coming end you should prepare
And your sweet semblance to some other give
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Find no determination then you were
Yourself again after yourselfs decease
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay
Which husbandry in honour might uphold
Against the stormy gusts of winters day
And barren rage of deaths eternal cold
O none but unthrifts Dear my love you know
You had a father let your son say so
My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun
Coral is far more red than her lips red
If snow be white why then her breasts are dun
If hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
I have seen roses damasked red and white
But no such roses see I in her cheeks
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
I love to hear her speak yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound
I grant I never saw a goddess go
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground
And yet by heaven I think my love as rare
As any she belied with false compare
Thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
For well thou knowst to my dear doting heart
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
Yet in good faith some say that thee behold
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan
To say they err I dare not be so bold
Although I swear it to myself alone
And to be sure that is not false I swear
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face
One on anothers neck do witness bear
Thy black is fairest in my judgments place
In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
And thence this slander as I think proceeds
Thine eyes I love and they as pitying me
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain
Have put on black and loving mourners be
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
And truly not the morning sun of heaven
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
Nor that full star that ushers in the even
Doth half that glory to the sober west
As those two mourning eyes become thy face
O let it then as well beseem thy heart
To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
And suit thy pity like in every part
Then will I swear beauty herself is black
And all they foul that thy complexion lack
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me
Ist not enough to torture me alone
But slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be
Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed
Of him myself and thee I am forsaken
A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed
Prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward
But then my friends heart let my poor heart bail
Whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard
Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail
And yet thou wilt for I being pent in thee
Perforce am thine and all that is in me
So now I have confessed that he is thine
And I my self am mortgaged to thy will
Myself Ill forfeit so that other mine
Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
But thou wilt not nor he will not be free
For thou art covetous and he is kind
He learned but suretylike to write for me
Under that bond that him as fist doth bind
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
Thou usurer that puttst forth all to use
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake
So him I lose through my unkind abuse
Him have I lost thou hast both him and me
He pays the whole and yet am I not free
Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will
And Will to boot and Will in overplus
More than enough am I that vex thee still
To thy sweet will making addition thus
Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
Shall will in others seem right gracious
And in my will no fair acceptance shine
The sea all water yet receives rain still
And in abundance addeth to his store
So thou being rich in will add to thy will
One will of mine to make thy large will more
Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
Think all but one and me in that one Will
If thy soul check thee that I come so near
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will
And will thy soul knows is admitted there
Thus far for love my love suit sweet fulfil
Will will fulfil the treasure of thy love
Ay fill it full with wills and my will one
In things of great receipt with case we prove
Among a number one is reckoned none
Then in the number let me pass untold
Though in thy stores account I one must be
For nothing hold me so it please thee hold
That nothing me a something sweet to thee
Make but my name thy love and love that still
And then thou lovst me for my name is Will
Thou blind fool Love what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see
They know what beauty is see where it lies
Yet what the best is take the worst to be
If eyes corrupt by overpartial looks
Be anchored in the bay where all men ride
Why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
Why should my heart think that a several plot
Which my heart knows the wide worlds common place
Or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
To put fair truth upon so foul a face
In things right true my heart and eyes have erred
And to this false plague are they now transferred
When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies
That she might think me some untutored youth
Unlearned in the worlds false subtleties
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
Although she knows my days are past the best
Simply I credit her falsespeaking tongue
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed
But wherefore says she not she is unjust
And wherefore say not I that I am old
O loves best habit is in seeming trust
And age in love loves not to have years told
Therefore I lie with her and she with me
And in our faults by lies we flattered be
O call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
Use power with power and slay me not by art
Tell me thou lovst elsewhere but in my sight
Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
What needst thou wound with cunning when thy might
Is more than my oerpressed defence can bide
Let me excuse thee Ah my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies
And therefore from my face she turns my foes
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries
Yet do not so but since I am near slain
Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain
Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck
And yet methinks I have astronomy
But not to tell of good or evil luck
Of plagues of dearths or seasons quality
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell
Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
Or say with princes if it shall go well
By oft predict that I in heaven find
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive
And constant stars in them I read such art
As truth and beauty shall together thrive
If from thy self to store thou wouldst convert
Or else of thee this I prognosticate
Thy end is truths and beautys doom and date
Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck
And yet methinks I have astronomy
But not to tell of good or evil luck
Of plagues of dearths or seasons quality
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell
Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
Or say with princes if it shall go well
By oft predict that I in heaven find
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive
And constant stars in them I read such art
As truth and beauty shall together thrive
If from thy self to store thou wouldst convert
Or else of thee this I prognosticate
Thy end is truths and beautys doom and date
Be wise as thou art cruel do not press
My tonguetied patience with too much disdain
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express
The manner of my pitywanting pain
If I might teach thee wit better it were
Though not to love yet love to tell me so
As testy sick men when their deaths be near
No news but health from their physicians know
For if I should despair I should grow mad
And in my madness might speak ill of thee
Now this illwresting world is grown so bad
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
That I may not be so nor thou belied
Bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide
In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes
For they in thee a thousand errors note
But tis my heart that loves what they despise
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote
Nor are mine cars with thy tongues tune delighted
Nor tender feeling to base touches prone
Nor taste nor smell desire to be invited
To any sensual feast with thee alone
But my five wits nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be
Only my plague thus far I count my gain
That she that makes me sin awards me pain
Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving
O but with mine compare thou thine own state
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving
Or if it do not from those lips of thine
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine
Robbed others beds revenues of their rents
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lovst those
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
Root pity in thy heart that when it grows
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
By selfexample mayst thou be denied
Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch
One of her feathered creatures broke away
Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
To follow that which flies before her face
Not prizing her poor infants discontent
So runnst thou after that which flies from thee
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind
But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
And play the mothers part kiss me be kind
So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will
If thou turn back and my loud crying still
Two loves I have of comfort and despair
Which like two spirits do suggest me still
The better angel is a man right fair
The worser spirit a woman coloured ill
To win me soon to hell my female evil
Tempteth my better angel from my side
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil
Wooing his purity with her foul pride
And whether that my angel be turned fiend
Suspect I may yet not directly tell
But being both from me both to each friend
I guess one angel in anothers hell
Yet this shall I neer know but live in doubt
Till my bad angel fire my good one out
Those lips that Loves own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said I hate
To me that languished for her sake
But when she saw my woeful state
Straight in her heart did mercy come
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
Was used in giving gentle doom
And taught it thus anew to greet
I hate she altered with an end
That followed it as gentle day
Doth follow night who like a fiend
From heaven to hell is flown away
I hate from hate away she threw
And saved my life saying not you
Those lips that Loves own hand did make
Breathd forth the sound that said I hate
To me that languishd for her sake
But when she saw my woeful state
Straight in her heart did mercy come
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
Was used in giving gentle doom
And taught it thus anew to greet
I hate she alterd with an end
That followd it as gentle day
Doth follow night who like a fiend
From heaven to hell is flown away
I hate from hate away she threw
And savd my life saying not you
Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
My sinful earth these rebel powers array
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay
Why so large cost having so short a lease
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
Shall worms inheritors of this excess
Eat up thy charge is this thy bodys end
Then soul live thou upon thy servants loss
And let that pine to aggravate thy store
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
Within be fed without be rich no more
So shall thou feed on Death that feeds on men
And Death once dead theres no more dying then
Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
these rebel powers that thee array
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay
Why so large cost having so short a lease
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
Shall worms inheritors of this excess
Eat up thy charge Is this thy bodys end
Then soul live thou upon thy servants loss
And let that pine to aggravate thy store
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
Within be fed without be rich no more
So shalt thou feed on Death that feeds on men
And Death once dead theres no more dying then
My love is as a fever longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
Th uncertain sickly appetite to please
My reason the physician to my love
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
Hath left me and I desperate now approve
Desire is death which physic did except
Past cure I am now reason is past care
And franticmad with evermore unrest
My thoughts and my discourse as mad mens are
At random from the truth vainly expressed
For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
Who art as black as hell as dark as night
O me what eyes hath love put in my head
Which have no correspondence with true sight
Or if they have where is my judgment fled
That censures falsely what they see aright
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
What means the world to say it is not so
If it be not then love doth well denote
Loves eye is not so true as all mens no
How can it O how can loves eye be true
That is so vexed with watching and with tears
No marvel then though I mistake my view
The sun it self sees not till heaven clears
O cunning love with tears thou keepst me blind
Lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find
Canst thou O cruel say I love thee not
When I against my self with thee partake
Do I not think on thee when I forgot
Am of my self all tyrant for thy sake
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend
On whom frownst thou that I do fawn upon
Nay if thou lourst on me do I not spend
Revenge upon my self with present moan
What merit do I in my self respect
That is so proud thy service to despise
When all my best doth worship thy defect
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes
But love hate on for now I know thy mind
Those that can see thou lovst and I am blind
When I consider everything that grows
Holds in perfection but a little moment
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment
When I perceive that men as plants increase
Cheered and checkd even by the selfsame sky
Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
And wear their brave state out of memory
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay
To change your day of youth to sullied night
And all in war with Time for love of you
As he takes from you I engraft you new
When I consider every thing that grows
Holds in perfection but a little moment
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment
When I perceive that men as plants increase
Cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky
Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
And wear their brave state out of memory
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight
Where wasteful Time debateth with decay
To change your day of youth to sullied night
And all in war with Time for love of you
As he takes from you I engraft you new
O from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway
To make me give the lie to my true sight
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
That in the very refuse of thy deeds
There is such strength and warrantise of skill
That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more
The more I hear and see just cause of hate
O though I love what others do abhor
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state
If thy unworthiness raised love in me
More worthy I to be beloved of thee
Love is too young to know what conscience is
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love
Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
For thou betraying me I do betray
My nobler part to my gross bodys treason
My soul doth tell my body that he may
Triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason
But rising at thy name doth point out thee
As his triumphant prize Proud of this pride
He is contented thy poor drudge to be
To stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
No want of conscience hold it that I call
Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall
In loving thee thou knowst I am forsworn
But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
In act thy bedvow broke and new faith torn
In vowing new hate after new love bearing
But why of two oaths breach do I accuse thee
When I break twenty I am perjured most
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
And all my honest faith in thee is lost
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
Oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
Or made them swear against the thing they see
For I have sworn thee fair More perjured eye
To swear against the truth so foul a lie
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
A maid of Dians this advantage found
And his lovekindling fire did quickly steep
In a cold valleyfountain of that ground
Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love
A dateless lively heat still to endure
And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure
But at my mistress eye Loves brand newfired
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast
I sick withal the help of bath desired
And thither hied a sad distempered guest
But found no cure The bath for my help lies
Where Cupid got new firemy mistress eyes
The little love god lying once asleep
Laid by his side his heartinflaming brand
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
Came tripping by but in her maiden hand
The fairest votary took up that fire
Which many legions of true hearts had warmed
And so the general of hot desire
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed
This brand she quenched in a cool well by
Which from Loves fire took heat perpetual
Growing a bath and healthful remedy
For men discased but I my mistress thrall
Came there for cure and this by that I prove
Loves fire heats water water cools not love
But wherefore do not you a mightier way
Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time
And fortify your self in your decay
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme
Now stand you on the top of happy hours
And many maiden gardens yet unset
With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers
Much liker than your painted counterfeit
So should the lines of life that life repair
Which this Times pencil or my pupil pen
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
Can make you live your self in eyes of men
To give away your self keeps your self still
And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill
Who will believe my verse in time to come
If it were filled with your most high deserts
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts
If I could write the beauty of your eyes
And in fresh numbers number all your graces
The age to come would say This poet lies
Such heavenly touches neer touched earthly faces
So should my papers yellowed with their age
Be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue
And your true rights be termed a poets rage
And stretched metre of an antique song
But were some child of yours alive that time
You should live twice in it and in my rhyme
Shall I compare thee to a summers day
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
And summers lease hath all too short a date
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
And often is his gold complexion dimmed
And every fair from fair sometime declines
By chance or natures changing course untrimmed
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owst
Nor shall death brag thou wandrest in his shade
When in eternal lines to time thou growst
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see
So long lives this and this gives life to thee
Devouring Time blunt thou the lions paws
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws
And burn the longlived phoenix in her blood
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleetst
And do whateer thou wilt swiftfooted Time
To the wide world and all her fading sweets
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime
O carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
Him in thy course untainted do allow
For beautys pattern to succeeding men
Yet do thy worst old Time despite thy wrong
My love shall in my verse ever live young
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
And dig deep trenches in thy beautys field
Thy youths proud livery so gazed on now
Will be a tatterd weed of small worth held
Then being askd where all thy beauty lies
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days
To say within thine own deepsunken eyes
Were an alleating shame and thriftless praise
How much more praise deserved thy beautys use
If thou couldst answer This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse
Proving his beauty by succession thine
This were to be new made when thou art old
And see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
And dig deep trenches in thy beautys field
Thy youths proud livery so gazed on now
Will be a tattered weed of small worth held
Then being asked where all thy beauty lies
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days
To say within thine own deep sunken eyes
Were an alleating shame and thriftless praise
How much more praise deserved thy beautys use
If thou couldst answer This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse
Proving his beauty by succession thine
This were to be new made when thou art old
And see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold
A womans face with Natures own hand painted
Hast thou the mastermistress of my passion
A womans gentle heart but not acquainted
With shifting change as is false womens fashion
An eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
A man in hue all hues in his controlling
Which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth
And for a woman wert thou first created
Till Nature as she wrought thee fell adoting
And by addition me of thee defeated
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing
But since she pricked thee out for womens pleasure
Mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure
So is it not with me as with that muse
Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse
Who heaven it self for ornament doth use
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
Making a couplement of proud compare
With sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems
With Aprils firstborn flowers and all things rare
That heavens air in this huge rondure hems
O let me true in love but truly write
And then believe me my love is as fair
As any mothers child though not so bright
As those gold candles fixed in heavens air
Let them say more that like of hearsay well
I will not praise that purpose not to sell
My glass shall not persuade me I am old
So long as youth and thou are of one date
But when in thee Times furrows I behold
Then look I death my days should expiate
For all that beauty that doth cover thee
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart
Which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
How can I then be elder than thou art
O therefore love be of thyself so wary
As I not for myself but for thee will
Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill
Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
Thou gavst me thine not to give back again
As an unperfect actor on the stage
Who with his fear is put beside his part
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
Whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart
So I for fear of trust forget to say
The perfect ceremony of loves rite
And in mine own loves strength seem to decay
Oercharged with burden of mine own loves might
O let my books be then the eloquence
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast
Who plead for love and look for recompense
More than that tongue that more hath more expressed
O learn to read what silent love hath writ
To hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit
Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled
Thy beautys form in table of my heart
My body is the frame wherein tis held
And perspective it is best painters art
For through the painter must you see his skill
To find where your true image pictured lies
Which in my bosoms shop is hanging still
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
Are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun
Delights to peep to gaze therein on thee
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
They draw but what they see know not the heart
Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled
Thy beautys form in table of my heart
My body is the frame wherein tis held
And perspective it is best painters art
For through the painter must you see his skill
To find where your true image pictured lies
Which in my bosoms shop is hanging still
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
Are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun
Delights to peep to gaze therein on thee
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
They draw but what they see know not the heart
Let those who are in favour with their stars
Of public honour and proud titles boast
Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars
Unlooked for joy in that I honour most
Great princes favourites their fair leaves spread
But as the marigold at the suns eye
And in themselves their pride lies buried
For at a frown they in their glory die
The painful warrior famoused for fight
After a thousand victories once foiled
Is from the book of honour razed quite
And all the rest forgot for which he toiled
Then happy I that love and am beloved
Where I may not remove nor be removed
Lord of my love to whom in vassalage
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
To thee I send this written embassage
To witness duty not to show my wit
Duty so great which wit so poor as mine
May make seem bare in wanting words to show it
But that I hope some good conceit of thine
In thy souls thought all naked will bestow it
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving
Points on me graciously with fair aspect
And puts apparel on my tattered loving
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee
Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me
Weary with toil I haste me to my bed
The dear respose for limbs with travel tired
But then begins a journey in my head
To work my mind when bodys works expired
For then my thoughts from far where I abide
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide
Looking on darkness which the blind do see
Save that my souls imaginary sight
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view
Which like a jewel hung in ghastly night
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new
Lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
For thee and for myself no quiet find
How can I then return in happy plight
That am debarred the benefit of rest
When days oppression is not eased by night
But day by night and night by day oppressed
And each though enemies to eithers reign
Do in consent shake hands to torture me
The one by toil the other to complain
How far I toil still farther off from thee
I tell the day to please him thou art bright
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
So flatter I the swartcomplexioned night
When sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
And night doth nightly make griefs length seem stronger
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought
And with old woes new wail my dear times waste
Then can I drown an eye unused to flow
For precious friends hid in deaths dateless night
And weep afresh loves long since cancelled woe
And moan th expense of many a vanished sight
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone
And heavily from woe to woe tell oer
The sad account of forebemoaned moan
Which I new pay as if not paid before
But if the while I think on thee dear friend
All losses are restored and sorrows end
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
Which I by lacking have supposed dead
And there reigns love and all loves loving parts
And all those friends which I thought buried
How many a holy and obsequious tear
Hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye
As interest of the dead which now appear
But things removed that hidden in thee lie
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
Who all their parts of me to thee did give
That due of many now is thine alone
Their images I loved I view in thee
And thou all they hast all the all of me
If thou survive my wellcontented day
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover
And shalt by fortune once more resurvey
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
Compare them with the bettring of the time
And though they be outstripped by every pen
Reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
Exceeded by the height of happier men
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
Had my friends Muse grown with this growing age
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
To march in ranks of better equipage
But since he died and poets better prove
Theirs for their style Ill read his for his love
Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Flatter the mountaintops with sovereign eye
Kissing with golden face the meadows green
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
With ugly rack on his celestial face
And from the forlorn world his visage hide
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
Even so my sun one early morn did shine
With alltriumphant splendour on my brow
But out alack He was but one hour mine
The region cloud hath masked him from me now
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
Suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
And make me travel forth without my cloak
To let base clouds oertake me in my way
Hiding thy bravry in their rotten smoke
Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
To dry the rain on my stormbeaten face
For no man well of such a salve can speak
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
Though thou repent yet I have still the loss
Th offenders sorrow lends but weak relief
To him that bears the strong offences cross
Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds
No more be grieved at that which thou hast done
Roses have thorns and silver fountains mud
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
All men make faults and even I in this
Authorizing thy trespass with compare
Myself corrupting salving thy amiss
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense
Thy adverse party is thy advocate
And gainst my self a lawful plea commence
Such civil war is in my love and hate
That I an accessary needs must be
To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me
Let me confess that we two must be twain
Although our undivided loves are one
So shall those blots that do with me remain
Without thy help by me be borne alone
In our two loves there is but one respect
Though in our lives a separable spite
Which though it alter not loves sole effect
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight
I may not evermore acknowledge thee
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
Nor thou with public kindness honour me
Unless thou take that honour from thy name
But do not so I love thee in such sort
As thou being mine mine is thy good report
As a decrepit father takes delight
To see his active child do deeds of youth
So I made lame by Fortunes dearest spite
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
For whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
Or any of these all or all or more
Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit
I make my love engrafted to this store
So then I am not lame poor nor despised
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
That I in thy abundance am sufficed
And by a part of all thy glory live
Look what is best that best I wish in thee
This wish I have then ten times happy me
How can my muse want subject to invent
While thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse
Thine own sweet argument too excellent
For every vulgar paper to rehearse
O give thy self the thanks if aught in me
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight
For whos so dumb that cannot write to thee
When thou thy self dost give invention light
Be thou the tenth Muse ten times more in worth
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate
And he that calls on thee let him bring forth
Eternal numbers to outlive long date
If my slight muse do please these curious days
The pain be mine but thine shall be the praise
How can my Muse want subject to invent
While thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse
Thine own sweet argument too excellent
For every vulgar paper to rehearse
O give thyself the thanks if aught in me
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight
For whos so dumb that cannot write to thee
When thou thyself dost give invention light
Be thou the tenth Muse ten times more in worth
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate
And he that calls on thee let him bring forth
Eternal numbers to outlive long date
If my slight Muse do please these curious days
The pain be mine but thine shall be the praise
O how thy worth with manners may I sing
When thou art all the better part of me
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring
And what ist but mine own when I praise thee
Even for this let us divided live
And our dear love lose name of single one
That by this separation I may give
That due to thee which thou deservst alone
O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
To entertain the time with thoughts of love
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
And that thou teachest how to make one twain
By praising him here who doth hence remain
Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
Upon thy self thy beautys legacy
Natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend
And being frank she lends to those are free
Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
The bounteous largess given thee to give
Profitless usurer why dost thou use
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live
For having traffic with thyself alone
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone
What acceptable audit canst thou leave
Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee
Which used lives th executor to be
Take all my loves my love yea take them all
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before
No love my love that thou mayst true love call
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more
Then if for my love thou my love receivest
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
But yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest
By wilful taste of what thy self refusest
I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
Although thou steal thee all my poverty
And yet love knows it is a greater grief
To bear loves wrong than hates known injury
Lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes
Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits
When I am sometime absent from thy heart
Thy beauty and thy years full well befits
For still temptation follows where thou art
Gentle thou art and therefore to be won
Beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed
And when a woman woos what womans son
Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed
Ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear
And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth
Who lead thee in their riot even there
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth
Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
Thine by thy beauty being false to me
That thou hast her it is not all my grief
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief
A loss in love that touches me more nearly
Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye
Thou dost love her because thou knowst I love her
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me
Suffring my friend for my sake to approve her
If I lose thee my loss is my loves gain
And losing her my friend hath found that loss
Both find each other and I lose both twain
And both for my sake lay on me this cross
But heres the joy my friend and I are one
Sweet flattery Then she loves but me alone
When most I wink then do mine eyes best see
For all the day they view things unrespected
But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee
And darkly bright are bright in dark directed
Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
How would thy shadows form form happy show
To the clear day with thy much clearer light
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
How would I say mine eyes be blessed made
By looking on thee in the living day
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
All days are nights to see till I see thee
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought
Injurious distance should not stop my way
For then despite of space I would be brought
From limits far remote where thou dost stay
No matter then although my foot did stand
Upon the farthest earth removed from thee
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
As soon as think the place where he would be
But ah thought kills me that I am not thought
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
But that so much of earth and water wrought
I must attend times leisure with my moan
Receiving nought by elements so slow
But heavy tears badges of eithers woe
The other two slight air and purging fire
Are both with thee wherever I abide
The first my thought the other my desire
These presentabsent with swift motion slide
For when these quicker elements are gone
In tender embassy of love to thee
My life being made of four with two alone
Sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy
Until lifes composition be recured
By those swift messengers returned from thee
Who even but now come back again assured
Of thy fair health recounting it to me
This told I joy but then no longer glad
I send them back again and straight grow sad
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
How to divide the conquest of thy sight
Mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar
My heart mine eye the freedom of that right
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie
A closet never pierced with crystal eyes
But the defendant doth that plea deny
And says in him thy fair appearance lies
To cide this title is impanelled
A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
And by their verdict is determined
The clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part
As thus mine eyes due is thy outward part
And my hearts right thy inward love of heart
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
And each doth good turns now unto the other
When that mine eye is famished for a look
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
With my loves picture then my eye doth feast
And to the painted banquet bids my heart
Another time mine eye is my hearts guest
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part
So either by thy picture or my love
Thyself away art present still with me
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
And I am still with them and they with thee
Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
Awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight
How careful was I when I took my way
Each trifle under truest bars to thrust
That to my use it might unused stay
From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust
But thou to whom my jewels trifles are
Most worthy comfort now my greatest grief
Thou best of dearest and mine only care
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief
Thee have I not locked up in any chest
Save where thou art notthough I feel thou art
Within the gentle closure of my breast
From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
And even thence thou wilt be stoln I fear
For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear
Against that time if ever that time come
When I shall see thee frown on my defects
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
Called to that audit by advised respects
Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye
When love converted from the thing it was
Shall reasons find of settled gravity
Against that time do I ensconce me here
Within the knowledge of mine own desart
And this my hand against myself uprear
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part
To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
Since why to love I can allege no cause
Those hours that with gentle work did frame
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
Will play the tyrants to the very same
And that unfair which fairly doth excel
For neverresting Time leads summer on
To hideous winter and confounds him there
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
Beauty oersnowed and bareness everywhere
Then were not summers distillation left
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
Beautys effect with beauty were bereft
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was
But flowers distilled though they with winter meet
Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
How heavy do I journey on the way
When what I seek my weary travels end
Doth teach that case and that repose to say
Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend
The beast that bears me tired with my woe
Plods dully on to bear that weight in me
As if by some instinct the wretch did know
His rider loved not speed being made from thee
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
Which heavily he answers with a groan
More sharp to me than spurring to his side
For that same groan doth put this in my mind
My grief lies onward and my joy behind
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed
From where thou art why should I haste me thence
Till I return of posting is no need
O what excuse will my poor beast then find
When swift extremity can seem but slow
Then should I spur though mounted on the wind
In winged speed no motion shall I know
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace
Therefore desire of perfectst love being made
Shall neighno dull fleshin his fiery race
But love for love thus shall excuse my jade
Since from thee going he went wilfulslow
Towards thee Ill run and give him leave to go
So am I as the rich whose blessed key
Can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure
The which he will not every hour survey
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare
Since seldom coming in that long year set
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are
Or captain jewels in the carcanet
So is the time that keeps you as my chest
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
To make some special instant specialblest
By new unfolding his imprisoned pride
Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
Being had to triumph being lacked to hope
What is your substance whereof are you made
That millions of strange shadows on you tend
Since everyone hath every one one shade
And you but one can every shadow lend
Describe Adonis and the counterfeit
Is poorly imitated after you
On Helens cheek all art of beauty set
And you in Grecian tires are painted new
Speak of the spring and foison of the year
The one doth shadow of your beauty show
The other as your bounty doth appear
And you in every blessed shape we know
In all external grace you have some part
But you like none none you for constant heart
O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give
The rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
For that sweet odour which doth in it live
The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
As the perfumed tincture of the roses
Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
When summers breath their masked buds discloses
But for their virtue only is their show
They live unwooed and unrespected fade
Die to themselves Sweet roses do not so
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
And so of you beauteous and lovely youth
When that shall vade by verse distills your truth
Not marble nor the gilded monuments
Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time
When wasteful war shall statues overturn
And broils root out the work of masonry
Nor Mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn
The living record of your memory
Gainst death and alloblivious enmity
Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
Even in the eyes of all posterity
That wear this world out to the ending doom
So till the judgment that yourself arise
You live in this and dwell in lovers eyes
Sweet love renew thy force Be it not said
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite
Which but today by feeding is allayed
Tomorrow sharpened in his former might
So love be thou although today thou fill
Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness
Tomorrow see again and do not kill
The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness
Let this sad interim like the ocean be
Which parts the shore where two contracted new
Come daily to the banks that when they see
Return of love more blest may be the view
As call it winter which being full of care
Makes summers welcome thrice more wished more rare
Being your slave what should I do but tend
Upon the hours and times of your desire
I have no precious time at all to spend
Nor services to do till you require
Nor dare I chide the worldwithoutend hour
Whilst I my sovereign watch the clock for you
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
When you have bid your servant once adieu
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
Where you may be or your affairs suppose
But like a sad slave stay and think of naught
Save where you are how happy you make those
So true a fool is love that in your will
Though you do any thing he thinks no ill
That god forbid that made me first your slave
I should in thought control your times of pleasure
Or at your hand th account of hours to crave
Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
O let me suffer being at your beck
Th imprisoned absence of your liberty
And patience tame to sufferance bide each check
Without accusing you of injury
Be where you list your charter is so strong
That you your self may privilage your time
To what you will to you it doth belong
Your self to pardon of selfdoing crime
I am to wait though waiting so be hell
Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well
If there be nothing new but that which is
Hath been before how are our brains beguiled
Which labouring for invention bear amis
The second burthen of a former child
O that record could with a backward look
Even of five hundred courses of the sun
Show me your image in some antique book
Since mind at first in character was done
That I might see what the old world could say
To this composed wonder of your frame
Whether we are mended or wheer better they
Or whether revolution be the same
O sure I am the wits of former days
To subjects worse have given admiring praise
Then let not winters ragged hand deface
In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled
Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
With beautys treasure ere it be selfkilled
That use is not forbidden usury
Which happies those that pay the willing loan
Thats for thyself to breed another thee
Or ten times happier be it ten for one
Ten times thy self were happier than thou art
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
Leaving thee living in posterity
Be not selfwilled for thou art much too fair
To be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
So do our minutes hasten to their end
Each changing place with that which goes before
In sequent toil all forwards do contend
Nativity once in the main of light
Crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned
Crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
And delves the parallels in beautys brow
Feeds on the rarities of natures truth
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
Praising thy worth despite his cruel hand
Is it thy will thy image should keep open
My heavy eyelids to the weary night
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight
Is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee
So far from home into my deeds to pry
To find out shames and idle hours in me
The scope and tenure of thy jealousy
O no thy love though much is not so great
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
To play the watchman ever for thy sake
For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
From me far off with others all too near
Sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye
And all my soul and all my every part
And for this sin there is no remedy
It is so grounded inward in my heart
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine
No shape so true no truth of such account
And for my self mine own worth do define
As I all other in all worths surmount
But when my glass shows me myself indeed
Beated and chapped with tanned antiquity
Mine own selflove quite contrary I read
Self so selfloving were iniquity
Tis thee myself that for my self I praise
Painting my age with beauty of thy days
Against my love shall be as I am now
With Times injurious hand crushed and oerworn
When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
With lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
Hath travelled on to ages steepy night
And all those beauties whereof now hes king
Are vanishing or vanished out of sight
Stealing away the treasure of his spring
For such a time do I now fortify
Against confounding ages cruel knife
That he shall never cut from memory
My sweet loves beauty though my lovers life
His beauty shall in these black lines be seen
And they shall live and he in them still green
Against my love shall be as I am now
With Times injurious hand crushed and oerworn
When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
With lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
Hath travelled on to ages steepy night
And all those beauties whereof now hes king
Are vanishing or vanished out of sight
Stealing away the treasure of his spring
For such a time do I now fortify
Against confounding ages cruel knife
That he shall never cut from memory
My sweet loves beauty though my lovers life
His beauty shall in these black lines be seen
And they shall live and he in them still green
When I have seen by Times fell hand defaced
The richproud cost of outworn buried age
When sometime lofty towers I see downrazed
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore
And the firm soil win of the watery main
Increasing store with loss and loss with store
When I have seen such interchange of state
Or state it self confounded to decay
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
That Time will come and take my love away
This thought is as a death which cannot choose
But weep to have that which it fears to lose
Since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
But sad mortality oersways their power
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
Whose action is no stronger than a flower
O how shall summers honey breath hold out
Against the wrackful siege of battring days
When rocks impregnable are not so stout
Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays
O fearful meditation Where alack
Shall Times best jewel from Times chest lie hid
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
O none unless this miracle have might
That in black ink my love may still shine bright
Tired with all these for restful death I cry
As to behold desert a beggar born
And needy nothing trimmed in jollity
And purest faith unhappily forsworn
And gilded honour shamefully misplaced
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced
And strength by limping sway disabled
And art made tonguetied by authority
And folly doctorlike controlling skill
And simple truth miscalled simplicity
And captive good attending captain ill
Tired with all these from these would I be gone
Save that to die I leave my love alone
Ah wherefore with infection should he live
And with his presence grace impiety
That sin by him advantage should achieve
And lace it self with his society
Why should false painting imitate his cheek
And steal dead seeming of his living hue
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
Roses of shadow since his rose is true
Why should he live now Nature bankrupt is
Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins
For she hath no exchequer now but his
And proud of many lives upon his gains
O him she stores to show what wealth she had
In days long since before these last so bad
Those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
All tongues the voice of souls give thee that due
Uttring bare truth even so as foes commend
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned
But those same tongues that give thee so thine own
In other accents do this praise confound
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown
They look into the beauty of thy mind
And that in guess they measure by thy deeds
Then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
But why thy odour matcheth not thy show
The soil is this that thou dost common grow
Lo in the orient when the gracious light
Lifts up his burning head each under eye
Doth homage to his newappearing sight
Serving with looks his sacred majesty
And having climbed the steepup heavenly hill
Resembling strong youth in his middle age
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
Attending on his golden pilgrimage
But when from highmost pitch with weary car
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day
The eyes fore duteous now converted are
From his low tract and look another way
So thou thyself outgoing in thy noon
Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son
Lo in the orient when the gracious light
Lifts up his burning head each under eye
Doth homage to his newappearing sight
Serving with looks his sacred majesty
And having climbed the steepup heavenly hill
Resembling strong youth in his middle age
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
Attending on his golden pilgrimage
But when from highmost pitch with weary car
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day
The eyes fore duteous now converted are
From his low tract and look another way
So thou thy self outgoing in thy noon
Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
For slanders mark was ever yet the fair
The ornament of beauty is suspect
A crow that flies in heavens sweetest air
So thou be good slander doth but approve
Thy worth the greater being wooed of time
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
And thou presentst a pure unstained prime
Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
Either not assailed or victor being charged
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
To tie up envy evermore enlarged
If some suspect of ill masked not thy show
Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
For slanders mark was ever yet the fair
The ornament of beauty is suspect
A crow that flies in heavens sweetest air
So thou be good slander doth but approve
Thy worth the greater being wooed of time
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
And thou presentst a pure unstained prime
Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
Either not assailed or victor being charged
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
To tie up envy evermore enlarged
If some suspect of ill masked not thy show
Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe
No longer mourn for me when I am dead
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
Give warning to the world that I am fled
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
Nay if you read this line remember not
The hand that writ it for I love you so
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
If thinking on me then should make you woe
O if I say you look upon this verse
When I perhaps compounded am with clay
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse
But let your love even with my life decay
Lest the wise world should look into your moan
And mock you with me after I am gone
O lest the world should task you to recite
What merit lived in me that you should love
After my death dear love forget me quite
For you in me can nothing worthy prove
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie
To do more for me than mine own desert
And hang more praise upon deceased I
Than niggard truth would willingly impart
O lest your true love may seem false in this
That you for love speak well of me untrue
My name be buried where my body is
And live no more to shame nor me nor you
For I am shamed by that which I bring forth
And so should you to love things nothing worth
That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves or none or few do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold
Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang
In me thou seest the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west
Which by and by black night doth take away
Deaths second self that seals up all in rest
In me thou seest the glowing of such fire
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie
As the deathbed whereon it must expire
Consumed with that which it was nourished by
This thou perceivst which makes thy love more strong
To love that well which thou must leave ere long
But be contented when that fell arrest
Without all bail shall carry me away
My life hath in this line some interest
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay
When thou reviewest this thou dost review
The very part was consecrate to thee
The earth can have but earth which is his due
My spirit is thine the better part of me
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
The prey of worms my body being dead
The coward conquest of a wretchs knife
Too base of thee to be remembered
The worth of that is that which it contains
And that is this and this with thee remains
So are you to my thoughts as food to life
Or as sweetseasoned showers are to the ground
And for the peace of you I hold such strife
As twixt a miser and his wealth is found
Now proud as an enjoyer and anon
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure
Now counting best to be with you alone
Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure
Sometimes all full with feasting on your sight
And by and by clean starved for a look
Possessing or pursuing no delight
Save what is had or must from you be took
Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day
Or gluttoning on all or all away
Why is my verse so barren of new pride
So far from variation or quick change
Why with the time do I not glance aside
To newfound methods and to compounds strange
Why write I still all one ever the same
And keep invention in a noted weed
That every word doth almost tell my name
Showing their birth and where they did proceed
O know sweet love I always write of you
And you and love are still my argument
So all my best is dressing old words new
Spending again what is already spent
For as the sun is daily new and old
So is my love still telling what is told
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
These vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear
And of this book this learning mayst thou taste
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory
Thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know
Times thievish progress to eternity
Look what thy memory cannot contain
Commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
Those children nursed delivered from thy brain
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind
These offices so oft as thou wilt look
Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book
So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse
And found such fair assistance in my verse
As every alien pen hath got my use
And under thee their poesy disperse
Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly
Have added feathers to the learneds wing
And given grace a double majesty
Yet be most proud of that which I compile
Whose influence is thine and born of thee
In others works thou dost but mend the style
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be
But thou art all my art and dost advance
As high as learning my rude ignorance
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace
But now my gracious numbers are decayed
And my sick Muse doth give an other place
I grant sweet love thy lovely argument
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
He robs thee of and pays it thee again
He lends thee virtue and he stole that word
From thy behaviour beauty doth he give
And found it in thy cheek he can afford
No praise to thee but what in thee doth live
Then thank him not for that which he doth say
Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay
Music to hear why hearst thou music sadly
Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
Why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly
Or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy
If the true concord of welltuned sounds
By unions married do offend thine ear
They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
Mark how one string sweet husband to another
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering
Resembling sire and child and happy mother
Who all in one one pleasing note do sing
Whose speechless song being many seeming one
Sings this to thee Thou single wilt prove none
O how I faint when I of you do write
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name
And in the praise thereof spends all his might
To make me tonguetied speaking of your fame
But since your worth wide as the ocean is
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear
My saucy bark inferior far to his
On your broad main doth wilfully appear
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
Or being wrecked I am a worthless boat
He of tall building and of goodly pride
Then if he thrive and I be cast away
The worst was this my love was my decay
Or I shall live your epitaph to make
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten
From hence your memory death cannot take
Although in me each part will be forgotten
Your name from hence immortal life shall have
Though I once gone to all the world must die
The earth can yield me but a common grave
When you entombed in mens eyes shall lie
Your monument shall be my gentle verse
Which eyes not yet created shall oerread
And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
When all the breathers of this world are dead
You still shall livesuch virtue hath my pen
Where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men
I grant thou wert not married to my Muse
And therefore mayst without attaint oerlook
The dedicated words which writers use
Of their fair subject blessing every book
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise
And therefore art enforced to seek anew
Some fresher stamp of the timebettering days
And do so love yet when they have devised
What strained touches rhetoric can lend
Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
In true plain words by thy truetelling friend
And their gross painting might be better used
Where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused
I never saw that you did painting need
And therefore to your fair no painting set
I found or thought I found you did exceed
That barren tender of a poets debt
And therefore have I slept in your report
That you yourself being extant well might show
How far a modern quill doth come too short
Speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
This silence for my sin you did impute
Which shall be most my glory being dumb
For I impair not beauty being mute
When others would give life and bring a tomb
There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
Than both your poets can in praise devise
Who is it that says most which can say more
Than this rich praise that you alone are you
In whose confine immured is the store
Which should example where your equal grew
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
That to his subject lends not some small glory
But he that writes of you if he can tell
That you are you so dignifies his story
Let him but copy what in you is writ
Not making worse what nature made so clear
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit
Making his style admired every where
You to your beauteous blessings add a curse
Being fond on praise which makes your praises worse
Who is it that says most which can say more
Than this rich praise that you alone are you
In whose confine immured is the store
Which should example where your equal grew
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
That to his subject lends not some small glory
But he that writes of you if he can tell
That you are you so dignifies his story
Let him but copy what in you is writ
Not making worse what nature made so clear
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit
Making his style admired everywhere
You to your beauteous blessings add a curse
Being fond on praise which makes your praises worse
My tonguetied Muse in manners holds her still
While comments of your praise richly compiled
Reserve their character with golden quill
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed
I think good thoughts whilst other write good words
And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen
To every hymn that able spirit affords
In polished form of wellrefined pen
Hearing you praised I say Tis so tis true
And to the most of praise add something more
But that is in my thought whose love to you
Though words come hindmost holds his rank before
Then others for the breath of words respect
Me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse
Bound for the prize of alltooprecious you
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
Was it his spirit by spirits taught to write
Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
No neither he nor his compeers by night
Giving him aid my verse astonished
He nor that affable familiar ghost
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence
As victors of my silence cannot boast
I was not sick of any fear from thence
But when your countenance filled up his line
Then lacked I matter that enfeebled mine
Farewell Thou art too dear for my possessing
And like enough thou knowst thy estimate
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
My bonds in thee are all determinate
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting
And for that riches where is my deserving
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
And so my patent back again is swerving
Thyself thou gavst thy own worth then not knowing
Or me to whom thou gavst it else mistaking
So thy great gift upon misprision growing
Comes home again on better judgement making
Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter
In sleep a king but waking no such matter
When thou shalt be disposed to set me light
And place my merit in the eye of scorn
Upon thy side against myself Ill fight
And prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
With mine own weakness being best acquainted
Upon thy part I can set down a story
Of faults concealed wherein I am attainted
That thou in losing me shalt win much glory
And I by this will be a gainer too
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee
The injuries that to myself I do
Doing thee vantage doublevantage me
Such is my love to thee I so belong
That for thy right myself will bear all wrong
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault
And I will comment upon that offence
Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt
Against thy reasons making no defence
Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill
To set a form upon desired change
As Ill my self disgrace knowing thy will
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange
Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
Lest I too much profane should do it wrong
And haply of our old acquaintance tell
For thee against myself Ill vow debate
For I must neer love him whom thou dost hate
Is it for fear to wet a widows eye
That thou consumst thy self in single life
Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife
The world will be thy widow and still weep
That thou no form of thee hast left behind
When every private widow well may keep
By childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
But beautys waste hath in the world an end
And kept unused the user so destroys it
No love toward others in that bosom sits
That on himself such murdrous shame commits
Then hate me when thou wilt if ever now
Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
join with the spite of fortune make me bow
And do not drop in for an afterloss
Ah do not when my heart hath scaped this sorrow
Come in the rearward of a conquered woe
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow
To linger out a purposed overthrow
If thou wilt leave me do not leave me last
When other petty griefs have done their spite
But in the onset come so shall I taste
At first the very worst of fortunes might
And other strains of woe which now seem woe
Compared with loss of thee will not seem so
Some glory in their birth some in their skill
Some in their wealth some in their bodys force
Some in their garments though newfangled ill
Some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest
But these particulars are not my measure
All these I better in one general best
Thy love is better than high birth to me
Richer than wealth prouder than garments costs
Of more delight than hawks and horses be
And having thee of all mens pride I boast
Wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
All this away and me most wretched make
But do thy worst to steal thyself away
For term of life thou art assured mine
And life no longer than thy love will stay
For it depends upon that love of thine
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs
When in the least of them my life hath end
I see a better state to me belongs
Than that which on thy humour doth depend
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
O what a happy title do I find
Happy to have thy love happy to die
But whats so blessedfair that fears no blot
Thou mayst be false and yet I know it not
So shall I live supposing thou art true
Like a deceived husband so loves face
May still seem love to me though altered new
Thy looks with me thy heart in other place
For there can live no hatred in thine eye
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change
In manys looks the false hearts history
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
But heaven in thy creation did decree
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
Whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
How like Eves apple doth thy beauty grow
If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
So shall I live supposing thou art true
Like a deceived husband so loves face
May still seem love to me though altered new
Thy looks with me thy heart in other place
For there can live no hatred in thine eye
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change
In manys looks the false hearts history
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
But heaven in thy creation did decree
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
Whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
How like Eves apple doth thy beauty grow
If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
They that have power to hurt and will do none
That do not do the thing they most do show
Who moving others are themselves as stone
Unmoved cold and to temptation slow
They rightly do inherit heavens graces
And husband natures riches from expense
They are the lords and owners of their faces
Others but stewards of their excellence
The summers flower is to the summer sweet
Though to itself it only live and die
But if that flower with base infection meet
The basest weed outbraves his dignity
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
Which like a canker in the fragrant rose
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
That tongue that tells the story of thy days
Making lascivious comments on thy sport
Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise
Naming thy name blesses an ill report
O what a mansion have those vices got
Which for their habitation chose out thee
Where beautys veil doth cover every blot
And all things turns to fair that eyes can see
Take heed dear heart of this large privilege
The hardest knife illused doth lose his edge
Some say thy fault is youth some wantonness
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
Both grace and faults are loved of more and less
Thou makst faults graces that to thee resort
As on the finger of a throned queen
The basest jewel will be well esteemed
So are those errors that in thee are seen
To truths translated and for true things deemed
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray
If like a lamb he could his looks translate
How many gazers mightst thou lead away
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
But do not so I love thee in such sort
As thou being mine mine is thy good report
How like a winter hath my absence been
From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
What freezings have I felt what dark days seen
What old Decembers bareness everywhere
And yet this time removed was summers time
The teeming autumn big with rich increase
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime
Like widowed wombs after their lords decease
Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
But hope of orphans and unfathered fruit
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee
And thou away the very birds are mute
Or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer
That leaves look pale dreading the winters near
From you have I been absent in the spring
When proudpied April dressed in all his trim
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him
Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
Of different flowers in odour and in hue
Could make me any summers story tell
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
Nor did I wonder at the lilys white
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
They were but sweet but figures of delight
Drawn after you you pattern of all those
Yet seemed it winter still and you away
As with your shadow I with these did play
The forward violet thus did I chide
Sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells
If not from my loves breath The purple pride
Which on thy soft check for complexion dwells
In my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyed
The lily I condemned for thy hand
And buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand
One blushing shame another white despair
A third nor red nor white had stoln of both
And to his robbery had annexed thy breath
But for his theft in pride of all his growth
A vengeful canker eat him up to death
More flowers I noted yet I none could see
But sweet or colour it had stoln from thee
Where art thou Muse that thou forgetst so long
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might
Spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
Return forgetful Muse and straight redeem
In gentle numbers time so idly spent
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
And gives thy pen both skill and argument
Rise resty Muse my loves sweet face survey
If Time have any wrinkle graven there
If any be a satire to decay
And make Times spoils despised every where
Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life
So thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife
O truant Muse what shall be thy amends
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed
Both truth and beauty on my love depends
So dost thou too and therein dignified
Make answer Muse wilt thou not haply say
Truth needs no colour with his colour fixd
Beauty no pencil beautys truth to lay
But best is best if never intermixd
Because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb
Excuse not silence so fort lies in thee
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
And to be praised of ages yet to be
Then do thy office Muse I teach thee how
To make him seem long hence as he shows now
My love is strengthend though more weak in seeming
I love not less though less the show appear
That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
The owners tongue doth publish every where
Our love was new and then but in the spring
When I was wont to greet it with my lays
As Philomel in summers front doth sing
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days
Not that the summer is less pleasant now
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
But that wild music burthens every bough
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight
Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue
Because I would not dull you with my song
Alack what poverty my Muse brings forth
That having such a scope to show her pride
The argument all bare is of more worth
Than when it hath my added praise beside
O blame me not if I no more can write
Look in your glass and there appears a face
That overgoes my blunt invention quite
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
Were it not sinful then striving to mend
To mar the subject that before was well
For to no other pass my verses tend
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell
And more much more than in my verse can sit
Your own glass shows you when you look in it
To me fair friend you never can be old
For as you were when first your eye I eyed
Such seems your beauty still Three winters cold
Have from the forests shook three summers pride
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turnd
In process of the seasons have I seen
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burnd
Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green
Ah yet doth beauty like a dialhand
Steal from his figure and no pace perceived
So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
For fear of which hear this thou age unbred
Ere you were born was beautys summer dead
O never say that I was false of heart
Though absence seemd my flame to qualify
As easy might I from myself depart
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
That is my home of love if I have ranged
Like him that travels I return again
Just to the time not with the time exchanged
So that myself bring water for my stain
Never believe though in my nature reignd
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
That it could so preposterously be staind
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good
For nothing this wide universe I call
Save thou my rose in it thou art my all
O from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway
To make me give the lie to my true sight
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
That in the very refuse of thy deeds
There is such strength and warrantize of skill
That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more
The more I hear and see just cause of hate
O though I love what others do abhor
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state
If thy unworthiness raised love in me
More worthy I to be beloved of thee
Love is too young to know what conscience is
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love
Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
For thou betraying me I do betray
My nobler part to my gross bodys treason
My soul doth tell my body that he may
Triumph in love flesh stays no father reason
But rising at thy name doth point out thee
As his triumphant prize Proud of this pride
He is contented thy poor drudge to be
To stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
No want of conscience hold it that I call
Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall
In loving thee thou knowst I am forsworn
But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
In act thy bedvow broke and new faith torn
In vowing new hate after new love bearing
But why of two oaths breach do I accuse thee
When I break twenty I am perjured most
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
And all my honest faith in thee is lost
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
Oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
Or made them swear against the thing they see
For I have sworn thee fair more perjured I
To swear against the truth so foul a lie
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
A maid of Dians this advantage found
And his lovekindling fire did quickly steep
In a cold valleyfountain of that ground
Which borrowd from this holy fire of Love
A dateless lively heat still to endure
And grew a seething bath which yet men prove
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure
But at my mistress eye Loves brand newfired
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast
I sick withal the help of bath desired
And thither hied a sad distemperd guest
But found no cure the bath for my help lies
Where Cupid got new firemy mistress eyes
The little Lovegod lying once asleep
Laid by his side his heartinflaming brand
Whilst many nymphs that vowd chaste life to keep
Came tripping by but in her maiden hand
The fairest votary took up that fire
Which many legions of true hearts had warmd
And so the general of hot desire
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmd
This brand she quenched in a cool well by
Which from Loves fire took heat perpetual
Growing a bath and healthful remedy
For men diseased but I my mistress thrall
Came there for cure and this by that I prove
Loves fire heats water water cools not love
Let not my love be calld idolatry
Nor my beloved as an idol show
Since all alike my songs and praises be
To one of one still such and ever so
Kind is my love today tomorrow kind
Still constant in a wondrous excellence
Therefore my verse to constancy confined
One thing expressing leaves out difference
Fair kind and true is all my argument
Fair kind and true varying to other words
And in this change is my invention spent
Three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
Fair kind and true have often lived alone
Which three till now never kept seat in one
When in the chronicle of wasted time
I see descriptions of the fairest wights
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
Then in the blazon of sweet beautys best
Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
I see their antique pen would have expressd
Even such a beauty as you master now
So all their praises are but prophecies
Of this our time all you prefiguring
And for they lookd but with divining eyes
They had not skill enough your worth to sing
For we which now behold these present days
Had eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise
Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come
Can yet the lease of my true love control
Supposd as forfeit to a confind doom
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endurd
And the sad augurs mock their own presage
Incertainties now crown themselves assurd
And peace proclaims olives of endless age
Now with the drops of this most balmy time
My love looks fresh and Death to me subscribes
Since spite of him Ill live in this poor rhyme
While he insults oer dull and speechless tribes
And thou in this shalt find thy monument
When tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent
Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come
Can yet the lease of my true love control
Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
And the sad augurs mock their own presage
Incertainties now crown themselves assured
And peace proclaims olives of endless age
Now with the drops of this most balmy time
My love looks fresh and death to me subscribes
Since spite of him Ill live in this poor rhyme
While he insults oer dull and speechless tribes
And thou in this shalt find thy monument
When tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent
Whats in the brain that ink may character
Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit
Whats new to speak what new to register
That may express my love or thy dear merit
Nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine
I must each day say oer the very same
Counting no old thing old thou mine I thine
Even as when first I hallowd thy fair name
So that eternal love in loves fresh case
Weighs not the dust and injury of age
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place
But makes antiquity for aye his page
Finding the first conceit of love there bred
Where time and outward form would show it dead
Alas tis true I have gone here and there
And made myself a motley to the view
Gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear
Made old offences of affections new
Most true it is that I have lookd on truth
Askance and strangely but by all above
These blenches gave my heart another youth
And worse essays proved thee my best of love
Now all is done have what shall have no end
Mine appetite I never more will grind
On newer proof to try an older friend
A god in love to whom I am confined
Then give me welcome next my heaven the best
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast
O for my sake do you with Fortune chide
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
That did not better for my life provide
Than public means which public manners breeds
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand
And almost thence my nature is subdud
To what it works in like the dyers hand
Pity me then and wish I were renewd
Whilst like a willing patient I will drink
Potions of eisel gainst my strong infection
No bitterness that I will bitter think
Nor double penance to correct correction
Pity me then dear friend and I assure ye
Even that your pity is enough to cure me
O for my sake do you with Fortune chide
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
That did not better for my life provide
Than public means which public manners breeds
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand
And almost thence my nature is subdued
To what it works in like the dyers hand
Pity me then and wish I were renewd
Whilst like a willing patient I will drink
Potions of eisel gainst my strong infection
No bitterness that I will bitter think
Nor double penance to correct correction
Pity me then dear friend and I assure ye
Even that your pity is enough to cure me
Your love and pity doth the impression fill
Which vulgar scandal stampd upon my brow
For what care I who calls me well or ill
So you oergreen my bad my good allow
You are my all the world and I must strive
To know my shames and praises from your tongue
None else to me nor I to none alive
That my steeld sense or changes right or wrong
In so profound abysm I throw all care
Of others voices that my adders sense
To critic and to flatterer stopped are
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense
You are so strongly in my purpose bred
That all the world besides methinks are dead
Since I left you mine eye is in my mind
And that which governs me to go about
Doth part his function and is partly blind
Seems seeing but effectually is out
For it no form delivers to the heart
Of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch
For if it see the rudest or gentlest sight
The most sweet favour or deformedst creature
The mountain or the sea the day or night
The crow or dove it shapes them to your feature
Incapable of more replete with you
My most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue
Or whether doth my mind being crownd with you
Drink up the monarchs plague this flattery
Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true
And that your love taught it this alchemy
To make of monsters and things indigest
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble
Creating every bad a perfect best
As fast as objects to his beams assemble
Otis the first tis flattery in my seeing
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing
And to his palate doth prepare the cup
If it be poisond tis the lesser sin
That mine eye loves it and doth first begin
What potions have I drunk of Siren tears
Distilld from limbecks foul as hell within
Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears
Still losing when I saw myself to win
What wretched errors hath my heart committed
Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
In the distraction of this madding fever
O benefit of ill now I find true
That better is by evil still made better
And ruind love when it is built anew
Grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
So I return rebuked to my content
And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent
Be wise as thou art cruel do not press
My tonguetied patience with too much disdain
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express
The manner of my pitywanting pain
If I might teach thee wit better it were
Though not to love yet love to tell me so
As testy sick men when their deaths be near
No news but health from their physicians know
For if I should despair I should grow mad
And in my madness might speak ill of thee
Now this illwresting world is grown so bad
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
That I may not be so nor thou belied
Bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide
In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes
For they in thee a thousand errors note
But tis my heart that loves what they despise
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote
Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving
O but with mine compare thou thine own state
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving
Or if it do not from those lips of thine
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
And seald false bonds of love as oft as mine
Robbd others beds revenues of their rents
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lovest those
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
Root pity in thy heart that when it grows
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
By selfexample mayst thou be denied
Lo as a careful housewife runs to catch
One of her featherd creatures broke away
Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
To follow that which flies before her face
Not prizing her poor infants discontent
So runnst thou after that which flies from thee
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind
But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
And play the mothers part kiss me be kind
So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will
If thou turn back and my loud crying still
Two loves I have of comfort and despair
Which like two spirits do suggest me still
The better angel is a man right fair
The worser spirit a woman colourd ill
To win me soon to hell my female evil
Tempteth my better angel from my side
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil
Wooing his purity with her foul pride
And whether that my angel be turnd fiend
Suspect I may but not directly tell
But being both from me both to each friend
I guess one angel in anothers hell
Yet this shall I neer know but live in doubt
Till my bad angel fire my good one out
Canst thou O cruel say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake
Do I not think on thee when I forgot
Am of myself all tyrant for thy sake
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend
On whom frownst thou that I do fawn upon
Nay if thou lourst on me do I not spend
Revenge upon myself with present moan
What merit do I in myself respect
That is so proud thy service to despise
When all my best doth worship thy defect
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes
But love hate on for now I know thy mind
Those that can see thou lovest and I am blind
Those lips that Loves own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said I hate
To me that languishd for her sake
But when she saw my woeful state
Straight in her heart did mercy come
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
Was used in giving gentle doom
And taught it thus anew to greet
I hate she alterd with an end
That followd it as gentle day
Doth follow night who like a fiend
From heaven to hell is flown away
I hate from hate away she threw
And saved my life saying not you
Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
these rebel powers that thee array
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay
Why so large cost having so short a lease
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
Shall worms inheritors of this excess
Eat up thy charge is this thy bodys end
Then soul live thou upon thy servants loss
And let that pine to aggravate thy store
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
Within be fed without be rich no more
So shalt thou feed on Death that feeds on men
And Death once dead theres no more dying then
My love is as a fever longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
The uncertain sickly appetite to please
My reason the physician to my love
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
Hath left me and I desperate now approve
Desire is death which physic did except
Past cure I am now reason is past care
And franticmad with evermore unrest
My thoughts and my discourse as madmens are
At random from the truth vainly expressd
For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
Who art as black as hell as dark as night
O me what eyes hath Love put in my head
Which have no correspondence with true sight
Or if they have where is my judgment fled
That censures falsely what they see aright
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
What means the world to say it is not so
If it be not then love doth well denote
Loves eye is not so true as all mens No
How can it O how can Loves eye be true
That is so vexd with watching and with tears
No marvel then though I mistake my view
The sun itself sees not till heaven clears
O cunning Love with tears thou keepst me blind
Lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find
Those lines that I before have writ do lie
Even those that said I could not love you dearer
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
But reckoning time whose milliond accidents
Creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings
Tan sacred beauty blunt the sharpst intents
Divert strong minds to the course of altering things
Alas why fearing of times tyranny
Might I not then say Now I love you best
When I was certain oer incertainty
Crowning the present doubting of the rest
Love is a babe then might I not say so
To give full growth to that which still doth grow
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds
Or bends with the remover to remove
O no it is an everfixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken
It is the star to every wandering bark
Whose worths unknown although his height be taken
Loves not Times fool though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickles compass come
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
But bears it out even to the edge of doom
If this be error and upon me proved
I never writ nor no man ever loved
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds
Or bends with the remover to remove
O no it is an everfixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken
It is the star to every wandering bark
Whose worths unknown although his height be taken
Loves not Times fool though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickles compass come
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
But bears it out even to the edge of doom
If this be error and upon me proved
I never writ nor no man ever loved
Accuse me thus that I have scanted all
Wherein I should your great deserts repay
Forgot upon your dearest love to call
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day
That I have frequent been with unknown minds
And given to time your own dearpurchased right
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
Which should transport me farthest from your sight
Book both my wilfulness and errors down
And on just proof surmise accumulate
Bring me within the level of your frown
But shoot not at me in your wakend hate
Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
The constancy and virtue of your love
Like as to make our appetites more keen
With eager compounds we our palate urge
As to prevent our maladies unseen
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge
Even so being tuff of your neercloying sweetness
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding
And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
To be diseased ere that there was true needing
Thus policy in love to anticipate
The ills that were not grew to faults assured
And brought to medicine a healthful state
Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured
But thence I learn and find the lesson true
Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you
That you were once unkind befriends me now
And for that sorrow which I then did feel
Needs must I under my transgression bow
Unless my nerves were brass or hammerd steel
For if you were by my unkindness shaken
As I by yours youve passd a hell of time
And I a tyrant have no leisure taken
To weigh how once I suffered in your crime
O that our night of woe might have rememberd
My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
And soon to you as you to me then tenderd
The humble slave which wounded bosoms fits
But that your trespass now becomes a fee
Mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me
Tis better to be vile than vile esteemd
When not to be receives reproach of being
And the just pleasure lost which is so deemd
Not by our feeling but by others seeing
For why should others false adulterate eyes
Give salutation to my sportive blood
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies
Which in their wills count bad what I think good
No I am that I am and they that level
At my abuses reckon up their own
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel
By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown
Unless this general evil they maintain
All men are bad and in their badness reign
Thy gift thy tables are within my brain
Full characterd with lasting memory
Which shall above that idle rank remain
Beyond all date even to eternity
Or at the least so long as brain and heart
Have faculty by nature to subsist
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
Of thee thy record never can be missd
That poor retention could not so much hold
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score
Therefore to give them from me was I bold
To trust those tables that receive thee more
To keep an adjunct to remember thee
Were to import forgetfulness in me
No Time thou shalt not boast that I do change
Thy pyramids built up with newer might
To me are nothing novel nothing strange
They are but dressings of a former sight
Our dates are brief and therefore we admire
What thou dost foist upon us that is old
And rather make them born to our desire
Than think that we before have heard them told
Thy registers and thee I both defy
Not wondering at the present nor the past
For thy records and what we see doth lie
Made more or less by thy continual haste
This I do vow and this shall ever be
I will be true despite thy scythe and thee
The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
Is lust in action and till action lust
Is perjured murderous bloody full of blame
Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
Enjoyd no sooner but despised straight
Past reason hunted and no sooner had
Past reason hated as a swallowd bait
On purpose laid to make the taker mad
Mad in pursuit and in possession so
Had having and in quest to have extreme
A bliss in proof and proved a very woe
Before a joy proposed behind a dream
All this the world well knows yet none knows well
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
Were t aught to me I bore the canopy
With my extern the outward honouring
Or laid great bases for eternity
Which prove more short than waste or ruining
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
Lose all and more by paying too much rent
For compound sweet forgoing simple savour
Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
No let me be obsequious in thy heart
And take thou my oblation poor but free
Which is not mixd with seconds knows no art
But mutual render only me for thee
Hence thou subornd informer a true soul
When most impeachd stands least in thy control
O thou my lovely boy who in thy power
Dost hold Times fickle glass his sickle hour
Who hast by waning grown and therein showst
Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self growst
If Nature sovereign mistress over wrack
As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back
She keeps thee to this purpose that her skill
May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure
She may detain but not still keep her treasure
Her audit though delayd answerd must be
And her quietus is to render thee
How oft when thou my music music playst
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand
Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
At the woods boldness by thee blushing stand
To be so tickled they would change their state
And situation with those dancing chips
Oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
Making dead wood more blest than living lips
Since saucy jacks so happy are in this
Give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss
Thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
For well thou knowst to my dear doting heart
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
Yet in good faith some say that thee behold
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan
To say they err I dare not be so bold
Although I swear it to myself alone
And to be sure that is not false I swear
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face
One on anothers neck do witness bear
Thy black is fairest in my judgments place
In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
And thence this slander as I think proceeds
Thine eyes I love and they as pitying me
Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain
Have put on black and loving mourners be
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
And truly not the morning sun of heaven
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
Nor that full star that ushers in the even
Doth half that glory to the sober west
As those two mourning eyes become thy face
O let it then as well beseem thy heart
To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
And suit thy pity like in every part
Then will I swear beauty herself is black
And all they foul that thy complexion lack
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me
Ist not enough to torture me alone
But slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken
And my next self thou harder hast engrossd
Of him myself and thee I am forsaken
A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossd
Prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward
But then my friends heart let my poor heart bail
Whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard
Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol
And yet thou wilt for I being pent in thee
Perforce am thine and all that is in me
So now I have confessd that he is thine
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will
Myself Ill forfeit so that other mine
Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
But thou wilt not nor he will not be free
For thou art covetous and he is kind
He learnd but suretylike to write for me
Under that bond that him as fast doth bind
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
Thou usurer that putst forth all to use
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake
So him I lose through my unkind abuse
Him have I lost thou hast both him and me
He pays the whole and yet am I not free
O call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
Use power with power and slay me not by art
Tell me thou lovest elsewhere but in my sight
Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
What needst thou wound with cunning when thy might
Is more than my oerpressd defense can bide
Let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies
And therefore from my face she turns my foes
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries
Yet do not so but since I am near slain
Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain
Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy Will
And Will to boot and Will in overplus
More than enough am I that vex thee still
To thy sweet will making addition thus
Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
Shall will in others seem right gracious
And in my will no fair acceptance shine
The sea all water yet receives rain still
And in abundance addeth to his store
So thou being rich in Will add to thy Will
One will of mine to make thy large Will more
Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
Think all but one and me in that one Will
If thy soul cheque thee that I come so near
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will
And will thy soul knows is admitted there
Thus far for love my lovesuit sweet fulfil
Will will fulfil the treasure of thy love
Ay fill it full with wills and my will one
In things of great receipt with ease we prove
Among a number one is reckond none
Then in the number let me pass untold
Though in thy stores account I one must be
For nothing hold me so it please thee hold
That nothing me a something sweet to thee
Make but my name thy love and love that still
And then thou lovest me for my name is Will
Thou blind fool Love what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see
They know what beauty is see where it lies
Yet what the best is take the worst to be
If eyes corrupt by overpartial looks
Be anchord in the bay where all men ride
Why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
Why should my heart think that a several plot
Which my heart knows the wide worlds common place
Or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
To put fair truth upon so foul a face
In things right true my heart and eyes have erred
And to this false plague are they now transferrd
When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies
That she might think me some untutord youth
Unlearned in the worlds false subtleties
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
Although she knows my days are past the best
Simply I credit her false speaking tongue
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressd
But wherefore says she not she is unjust
And wherefore say not I that I am old
O loves best habit is in seeming trust
And age in love loves not to have years told
Therefore I lie with her and she with me
And in our faults by lies we flatterd be
From fairest creatures we desire increase
That thereby beautys rose might never die
But as the riper should by time decease
His tender heir might bear his memory
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
Feedst thy lightst flame with selfsubstantial fuel
Making a famine where abundance lies
Thyself thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
Thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
And tender churl makest waste in niggarding
Pity the world or else this glutton be
To eat the worlds due by the grave and thee
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
And dig deep trenches in thy beautys field
Thy youths proud livery so gazed on now
Will be a tatterd weed of small worth held
Then being askd where all thy beauty lies
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days
To say within thine own deepsunken eyes
Were an alleating shame and thriftless praise
How much more praise deserved thy beautys use
If thou couldst answer This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse
Proving his beauty by succession thine
This were to be new made when thou art old
And see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
Now is the time that face should form another
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
For where is she so fair whose uneard womb
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
Of his selflove to stop posterity
Thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee
Calls back the lovely April of her prime
So thou through windows of thine age shall see
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
But if thou live rememberd not to be
Die single and thine image dies with thee
Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
Upon thy self thy beautys legacy
Natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend
And being frank she lends to those are free
Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
The bounteous largess given thee to give
Profitless usurer why dost thou use
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live
For having traffic with thy self alone
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone
What acceptable audit canst thou leave
Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee
Which used lives th executor to be
Is it for fear to wet a widows eye
That thou consumest thyself in single life
Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife
The world will be thy widow and still weep
That thou no form of thee hast left behind
When every private widow well may keep
By childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
But beautys waste hath in the world an end
And kept unused the user so destroys it
No love toward others in that bosom sits
That on himself such murderous shame commits
How heavy do I journey on the way
When what I seek my weary travels end
Doth teach that ease and that repose to say
Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend
The beast that bears me tired with my woe
Plods dully on to bear that weight in me
As if by some instinct the wretch did know
His rider loved not speed being made from thee
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
Which heavily he answers with a groan
More sharp to me than spurring to his side
For that same groan doth put this in my mind
My grief lies onward and my joy behind
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed
From where thou art why should I haste me thence
Till I return of posting is no need
O what excuse will my poor beast then find
When swift extremity can seem but slow
Then should I spur though mounted on the wind
In winged speed no motion shall I know
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace
Therefore desire of perfectst love being made
Shall neighno dull fleshin his fiery race
But love for love thus shall excuse my jade
Since from thee going he went wilfulslow
Towards thee Ill run and give him leave to go
So am I as the rich whose blessed key
Can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure
The which he will not every hour survey
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare
Since seldom coming in the long year set
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are
Or captain jewels in the carcanet
So is the time that keeps you as my chest
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
To make some special instant special blest
By new unfolding his imprisond pride
Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
Being had to triumph being lackd to hope
What is your substance whereof are you made
That millions of strange shadows on you tend
Since every one hath every one one shade
And you but one can every shadow lend
Describe Adonis and the counterfeit
Is poorly imitated after you
On Helens cheek all art of beauty set
And you in Grecian tires are painted new
Speak of the spring and foison of the year
The one doth shadow of your beauty show
The other as your bounty doth appear
And you in every blessed shape we know
In all external grace you have some part
But you like none none you for constant heart
If there be nothing new but that which is
Hath been before how are our brains beguiled
Which labouring for invention bear amiss
The second burden of a former child
O that record could with a backward look
Even of five hundred courses of the sun
Show me your image in some antique book
Since mind at first in character was done
That I might see what the old world could say
To this composed wonder of your frame
Whether we are mended or whether better they
Or whether revolution be the same
O sure I am the wits of former days
To subjects worse have given admiring praise
Not marble nor the gilded monuments
Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Than unswept stone besmeard with sluttish time
When wasteful war shall statues overturn
And broils root out the work of masonry
Nor Mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn
The living record of your memory
Gainst death and alloblivious enmity
Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
Even in the eyes of all posterity
That wear this world out to the ending doom
So till the judgment that yourself arise
You live in this and dwell in lovers eyes
Sweet love renew thy force be it not said
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite
Which but today by feeding is allayd
Tomorrow sharpend in his former might
So love be thou although today thou fill
Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness
Tomorrow see again and do not kill
The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness
Let this sad interim like the ocean be
Which parts the shore where two contracted new
Come daily to the banks that when they see
Return of love more blest may be the view
Else call it winter which being full of care
Makes summers welcome thrice more wishd more rare
Being your slave what should I do but tend
Upon the hours and times of your desire
I have no precious time at all to spend
Nor services to do till you require
Nor dare I chide the worldwithoutend hour
Whilst I my sovereign watch the clock for you
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
When you have bid your servant once adieu
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
Where you may be or your affairs suppose
But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
Save where you are how happy you make those
So true a fool is love that in your will
Though you do any thing he thinks no ill
That god forbid that made me first your slave
I should in thought control your times of pleasure
Or at your hand the account of hours to crave
Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
O let me suffer being at your beck
The imprisond absence of your liberty
And patience tame to sufferance bide each cheque
Without accusing you of injury
Be where you list your charter is so strong
That you yourself may privilege your time
To what you will to you it doth belong
Yourself to pardon of selfdoing crime
I am to wait though waiting so be hell
Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
So do our minutes hasten to their end
Each changing place with that which goes before
In sequent toil all forwards do contend
Nativity once in the main of light
Crawls to maturity wherewith being crownd
Crooked elipses gainst his glory fight
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
And delves the parallels in beautys brow
Feeds on the rarities of natures truth
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
Praising thy worth despite his cruel hand
Is it thy will thy image should keep open
My heavy eyelids to the weary night
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight
Is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee
So far from home into my deeds to pry
To find out shames and idle hours in me
The scope and tenor of thy jealousy
O no thy love though much is not so great
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
To play the watchman ever for thy sake
For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
From me far off with others all too near
Sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye
And all my soul and all my every part
And for this sin there is no remedy
It is so grounded inward in my heart
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine
No shape so true no truth of such account
And for myself mine own worth do define
As I all other in all worths surmount
But when my glass shows me myself indeed
Beated and choppd with tannd antiquity
Mine own selflove quite contrary I read
Self so selfloving were iniquity
Tis thee myself that for myself I praise
Painting my age with beauty of thy days
Against my love shall be as I am now
With Times injurious hand crushd and oerworn
When hours have draind his blood and filld his brow
With lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
Hath travelld on to ages steepy night
And all those beauties whereof now hes king
Are vanishing or vanishd out of sight
Stealing away the treasure of his spring
For such a time do I now fortify
Against confounding ages cruel knife
That he shall never cut from memory
My sweet loves beauty though my lovers life
His beauty shall in these black lines be seen
And they shall live and he in them still green
Those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
All tongues the voice of souls give thee that due
Uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crownd
But those same tongues that give thee so thine own
In other accents do this praise confound
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown
They look into the beauty of thy mind
And that in guess they measure by thy deeds
Then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
But why thy odour matcheth not thy show
The solve is this that thou dost common grow
Since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
But sad mortality oersways their power
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
Whose action is no stronger than a flower
O how shall summers honey breath hold out
Against the wreckful siege of battering days
When rocks impregnable are not so stout
Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays
O fearful meditation where alack
Shall Times best jewel from Times chest lie hid
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
O none unless this miracle have might
That in black ink my love may still shine bright
Tired with all these for restful death I cry
As to behold desert a beggar born
And needy nothing trimmd in jollity
And purest faith unhappily forsworn
And guilded honour shamefully misplaced
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced
And strength by limping sway disabled
And art made tonguetied by authority
And folly doctorlike controlling skill
And simple truth miscalld simplicity
And captive good attending captain ill
Tired with all these from these would I be gone
Save that to die I leave my love alone
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
For slanders mark was ever yet the fair
The ornament of beauty is suspect
A crow that flies in heavens sweetest air
So thou be good slander doth but approve
Thy worth the greater being wood of time
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
And thou presentst a pure unstained prime
Thou hast passd by the ambush of young days
Either not assaild or victor being charged
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
To tie up envy evermore enlarged
If some suspect of ill maskd not thy show
Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe
No longer mourn for me when I am dead
Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell
Give warning to the world that I am fled
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
Nay if you read this line remember not
The hand that writ it for I love you so
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
If thinking on me then should make you woe
O if I say you look upon this verse
When I perhaps compounded am with clay
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse
But let your love even with my life decay
Lest the wise world should look into your moan
And mock you with me after I am gone
O lest the world should task you to recite
What merit lived in me that you should love
After my death dear love forget me quite
For you in me can nothing worthy prove
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie
To do more for me than mine own desert
And hang more praise upon deceased I
Than niggard truth would willingly impart
O lest your true love may seem false in this
That you for love speak well of me untrue
My name be buried where my body is
And live no more to shame nor me nor you
For I am shamed by that which I bring forth
And so should you to love things nothing worth
That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves or none or few do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold
Bare ruind choirs where late the sweet birds sang
In me thou seest the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west
Which by and by black night doth take away
Deaths second self that seals up all in rest
In me thou seest the glowing of such fire
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie
As the deathbed whereon it must expire
Consumed with that which it was nourishd by
This thou perceivest which makes thy love more strong
To love that well which thou must leave ere long
But be contented when that fell arrest
Without all bail shall carry me away
My life hath in this line some interest
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay
When thou reviewest this thou dost review
The very part was consecrate to thee
The earth can have but earth which is his due
My spirit is thine the better part of me
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
The prey of worms my body being dead
The coward conquest of a wretchs knife
Too base of thee to be remembered
The worth of that is that which it contains
And that is this and this with thee remains
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace
But now my gracious numbers are decayd
And my sick Muse doth give another place
I grant sweet love thy lovely argument
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
He robs thee of and pays it thee again
He lends thee virtue and he stole that word
From thy behavior beauty doth he give
And found it in thy cheek he can afford
No praise to thee but what in thee doth live
Then thank him not for that which he doth say
Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay
So are you to my thoughts as food to life
Or as sweetseasond showers are to the ground
And for the peace of you I hold such strife
As twixt a miser and his wealth is found
Now proud as an enjoyer and anon
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure
Now counting best to be with you alone
Then betterd that the world may see my pleasure
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight
And by and by clean starved for a look
Possessing or pursuing no delight
Save what is had or must from you be took
Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day
Or gluttoning on all or all away
Why is my verse so barren of new pride
So far from variation or quick change
Why with the time do I not glance aside
To newfound methods and to compounds strange
Why write I still all one ever the same
And keep invention in a noted weed
That every word doth almost tell my name
Showing their birth and where they did proceed
O know sweet love I always write of you
And you and love are still my argument
So all my best is dressing old words new
Spending again what is already spent
For as the sun is daily new and old
So is my love still telling what is told
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
The vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear
And of this book this learning mayst thou taste
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory
Thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know
Times thievish progress to eternity
Look what thy memory can not contain
Commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
Those children nursed deliverd from thy brain
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind
These offices so oft as thou wilt look
Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book
So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse
And found such fair assistance in my verse
As every alien pen hath got my use
And under thee their poesy disperse
Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly
Have added feathers to the learneds wing
And given grace a double majesty
Yet be most proud of that which I compile
Whose influence is thine and born of thee
In others works thou dost but mend the style
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be
But thou art all my art and dost advance
As high as learning my rude ignorance
O how I faint when I of you do write
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name
And in the praise thereof spends all his might
To make me tonguetied speaking of your fame
But since your worth wide as the ocean is
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear
My saucy bark inferior far to his
On your broad main doth wilfully appear
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
Or being wreckd I am a worthless boat
He of tall building and of goodly pride
Then if he thrive and I be cast away
The worst was this my love was my decay
Or I shall live your epitaph to make
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten
From hence your memory death cannot take
Although in me each part will be forgotten
Your name from hence immortal life shall have
Though I once gone to all the world must die
The earth can yield me but a common grave
When you entombed in mens eyes shall lie
Your monument shall be my gentle verse
Which eyes not yet created shall oerread
And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
When all the breathers of this world are dead
You still shall livesuch virtue hath my pen
Where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men
I grant thou wert not married to my Muse
And therefore mayst without attaint oerlook
The dedicated words which writers use
Of their fair subject blessing every book
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise
And therefore art enforced to seek anew
Some fresher stamp of the timebettering days
And do so love yet when they have devised
What strained touches rhetoric can lend
Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
In true plain words by thy truetelling friend
And their gross painting might be better used
Where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused
I never saw that you did painting need
And therefore to your fair no painting set
I found or thought I found you did exceed
The barren tender of a poets debt
And therefore have I slept in your report
That you yourself being extant well might show
How far a modern quill doth come too short
Speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
This silence for my sin you did impute
Which shall be most my glory being dumb
For I impair not beauty being mute
When others would give life and bring a tomb
There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
Than both your poets can in praise devise
Who is it that says most which can say more
Than this rich praise that you alone are you
In whose confine immured is the store
Which should example where your equal grew
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
That to his subject lends not some small glory
But he that writes of you if he can tell
That you are you so dignifies his story
Let him but copy what in you is writ
Not making worse what nature made so clear
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit
Making his style admired every where
You to your beauteous blessings add a curse
Being fond on praise which makes your praises worse
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault
And I will comment upon that offence
Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt
Against thy reasons making no defence
Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill
To set a form upon desired change
As Ill myself disgrace knowing thy will
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange
Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
Lest I too much profane should do it wrong
And haply of our old acquaintance tell
For thee against myself Ill vow debate
For I must neer love him whom thou dost hate
My tonguetied Muse in manners holds her still
While comments of your praise richly compiled
Reserve their character with golden quill
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed
I think good thoughts whilst other write good words
And like unletterd clerk still cry Amen
To every hymn that able spirit affords
In polishd form of wellrefined pen
Hearing you praised I say Tis so tis true
And to the most of praise add something more
But that is in my thought whose love to you
Though words come hindmost holds his rank before
Then others for the breath of words respect
Me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse
Bound for the prize of all too precious you
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
Was it his spirit by spirits taught to write
Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
No neither he nor his compeers by night
Giving him aid my verse astonished
He nor that affable familiar ghost
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence
As victors of my silence cannot boast
I was not sick of any fear from thence
But when your countenance filld up his line
Then lackd I matter that enfeebled mine
Farewell thou art too dear for my possessing
And like enough thou knowst thy estimate
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
My bonds in thee are all determinate
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting
And for that riches where is my deserving
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
And so my patent back again is swerving
Thyself thou gavest thy own worth then not knowing
Or me to whom thou gavest it else mistaking
So thy great gift upon misprision growing
Comes home again on better judgment making
Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter
In sleep a king but waking no such matter
When thou shalt be disposed to set me light
And place my merit in the eye of scorn
Upon thy side against myself Ill fight
And prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
With mine own weakness being best acquainted
Upon thy part I can set down a story
Of faults conceald wherein I am attainted
That thou in losing me shalt win much glory
And I by this will be a gainer too
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee
The injuries that to myself I do
Doing thee vantage doublevantage me
Such is my love to thee I so belong
That for thy right myself will bear all wrong
Those hours that with gentle work did frame
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
Will play the tyrants to the very same
And that unfair which fairly doth excel
For neverresting time leads summer on
To hideous winter and confounds him there
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
Beauty oersnowed and bareness every where
Then were not summers distillation left
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
Beautys effect with beauty were bereft
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was
But flowers distilld though they with winter meet
Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
Then let not winters ragged hand deface
In thee thy summer ere thou be distilld
Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
With beautys treasure ere it be selfkilld
That use is not forbidden usury
Which happies those that pay the willing loan
Thats for thyself to breed another thee
Or ten times happier be it ten for one
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
Leaving thee living in posterity
Be not selfwilld for thou art much too fair
To be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir
Lo in the orient when the gracious light
Lifts up his burning head each under eye
Doth homage to his newappearing sight
Serving with looks his sacred majesty
And having climbd the steepup heavenly hill
Resembling strong youth in his middle age
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
Attending on his golden pilgrimage
But when from highmost pitch with weary car
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day
The eyes fore duteous now converted are
From his low tract and look another way
So thou thyself outgoing in thy noon
Unlookd on diest unless thou get a son
Music to hear why hearst thou music sadly
Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly
Or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy
If the true concord of welltuned sounds
By unions married do offend thine ear
They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
Mark how one string sweet husband to another
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering
Resembling sire and child and happy mother
Who all in one one pleasing note do sing
Whose speechless song being many seeming one
Sings this to thee thou single wilt prove none
For shame deny that thou bearst love to any
Who for thyself art so unprovident
Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
But that thou none lovest is most evident
For thou art so possessd with murderous hate
That gainst thyself thou stickst not to conspire
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Which to repair should be thy chief desire
O change thy thought that I may change my mind
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
Be as thy presence is gracious and kind
Or to thyself at least kindhearted prove
Make thee another self for love of me
That beauty still may live in thine or thee
Then hate me when thou wilt if ever now
Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
Join with the spite of fortune make me bow
And do not drop in for an afterloss
Ah do not when my heart hath scoped this sorrow
Come in the rearward of a conquerd woe
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow
To linger out a purposed overthrow
If thou wilt leave me do not leave me last
When other petty griefs have done their spite
But in the onset come so shall I taste
At first the very worst of fortunes might
And other strains of woe which now seem woe
Compared with loss of thee will not seem so
Some glory in their birth some in their skill
Some in their wealth some in their bodies force
Some in their garments though newfangled ill
Some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest
But these particulars are not my measure
All these I better in one general best
Thy love is better than high birth to me
Richer than wealth prouder than garments cost
Of more delight than hawks or horses be
And having thee of all mens pride I boast
Wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
All this away and me most wretched make
So shall I live supposing thou art true
Like a deceived husband so loves face
May still seem love to me though alterd new
Thy looks with me thy heart in other place
For there can live no hatred in thine eye
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change
In manys looks the false hearts history
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
But heaven in thy creation did decree
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
Whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
How like Eves apple doth thy beauty grow
if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
They that have power to hurt and will do none
That do not do the thing they most do show
Who moving others are themselves as stone
Unmoved cold and to temptation slow
They rightly do inherit heavens graces
And husband natures riches from expense
They are the lords and owners of their faces
Others but stewards of their excellence
The summers flower is to the summer sweet
Though to itself it only live and die
But if that flower with base infection meet
The basest weed outbraves his dignity
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds
The forward violet thus did I chide
Sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells
If not from my loves breath The purple pride
Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
In my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyed
The lily I condemned for thy hand
And buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand
One blushing shame another white despair
A third nor red nor white had stoln of both
And to his robbery had annexd thy breath
But for his theft in pride of all his growth
A vengeful canker eat him up to death
More flowers I noted yet I none could see
But sweet or colour it had stoln from thee
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
Which like a canker in the fragrant rose
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
That tongue that tells the story of thy days
Making lascivious comments on thy sport
Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise
Naming thy name blesses an ill report
O what a mansion have those vices got
Which for their habitation chose out thee
Where beautys veil doth cover every blot
And all things turn to fair that eyes can see
Take heed dear heart of this large privilege
The hardest knife illused doth lose his edge
Some say thy fault is youth some wantonness
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
Both grace and faults are loved of more and less
Thou makest faults graces that to thee resort
As on the finger of a throned queen
The basest jewel will be well esteemd
So are those errors that in thee are seen
To truths translated and for true things deemd
How many lambs might the stem wolf betray
If like a lamb he could his looks translate
How many gazers mightst thou lead away
If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
But do not so I love thee in such sort
As thou being mine mine is thy good report
How like a winter hath my absence been
From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
What freezings have I felt what dark days seen
What old Decembers bareness every where
And yet this time removed was summers time
The teeming autumn big with rich increase
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime
Like widowd wombs after their lords decease
Yet this abundant issue seemd to me
But hope of orphans and unfatherd fruit
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee
And thou away the very birds are mute
Or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer
That leaves look pale dreading the winters near
From you have I been absent in the spring
When proudpied April dressd in all his trim
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
That heavy Saturn laughd and leapd with him
Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
Of different flowers in odour and in hue
Could make me any summers story tell
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
Nor did I wonder at the lilys white
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
They were but sweet but figures of delight
Drawn after you you pattern of all those
Yet seemd it winter still and you away
As with your shadow I with these did play
As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growest
In one of thine from that which thou departest
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
Herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
Without this folly age and cold decay
If all were minded so the times should cease
And threescore year would make the world away
Let those whom Nature hath not made for store
Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
Look whom she best endowd she gave the more
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
She carved thee for her seal and meant thereby
Thou shouldst print more not let that copy die
When I do count the clock that tells the time
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night
When I behold the violet past prime
And sable curls all silverd oer with white
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
And summers green all girded up in sheaves
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
Then of thy beauty do I question make
That thou among the wastes of time must go
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
And die as fast as they see others grow
And nothing gainst Times scythe can make defence
Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence
O that you were yourself but love you are
No longer yours than you yourself here live
Against this coming end you should prepare
And your sweet semblance to some other give
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Find no determination then you were
Yourself again after yourselfs decease
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay
Which husbandry in honour might uphold
Against the stormy gusts of winters day
And barren rage of deaths eternal cold
O none but unthrifts Dear my love you know
You had a father let your son say so
Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck
And yet methinks I have astronomy
But not to tell of good or evil luck
Of plagues of dearths or seasons quality
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell
Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
Or say with princes if it shall go well
By oft predict that I in heaven find
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive
And constant stars in them I read such art
As truth and beauty shall together thrive
If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert
Or else of thee this I prognosticate
Thy end is truths and beautys doom and date
Devouring Time blunt thou the lions paws
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws
And burn the longlivd Phoenix in her blood
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets
And do whateer thou wilt swiftfooted Time
To the wide world and all her fading sweets
But I forbid thee one more heinous crime
O carve not with the hours my loves fair brow
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
Him in thy course untainted do allow
For beautys pattern to succeeding men
Yet do thy worst old Time Despite thy wrong
My love shall in my verse ever live young
Take all my loves my love yea take them all
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before
No love my love that thou mayst true love call
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more
Then if for my love thou my love receivest
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
But yet be blamed if thou thyself deceivest
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest
I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
Although thou steal thee all my poverty
And yet love knows it is a greater grief
To bear loves wrong than hates known injury
Lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes
Those petty wrongs that liberty commits
When I am sometime absent from thy heart
Thy beauty and thy years full well befits
For still temptation follows where thou art
Gentle thou art and therefore to be won
Beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed
And when a woman woos what womans son
Will sourly leave her till she have prevailed
Ay me but yet thou mightest my seat forbear
And chide try beauty and thy straying youth
Who lead thee in their riot even there
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth
Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
Thine by thy beauty being false to me
That thou hast her it is not all my grief
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief
A loss in love that touches me more nearly
Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye
Thou dost love her because thou knowst I love her
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me
Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her
If I lose thee my loss is my loves gain
And losing her my friend hath found that loss
Both find each other and I lose both twain
And both for my sake lay on me this cross
But heres the joy my friend and I are one
Sweet flattery then she loves but me alone
When most I wink then do mine eyes best see
For all the day they view things unrespected
But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee
And darkly bright are bright in dark directed
Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
How would thy shadows form form happy show
To the clear day with thy much clearer light
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
How would I say mine eyes be blessed made
By looking on thee in the living day
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
All days are nights to see till I see thee
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought
Injurious distance should not stop my way
For then despite of space I would be brought
From limits far remote where thou dost stay
No matter then although my foot did stand
Upon the farthest earth removed from thee
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
As soon as think the place where he would be
But ah thought kills me that I am not thought
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
But that so much of earth and water wrought
I must attend times leisure with my moan
Receiving nought by elements so slow
But heavy tears badges of eithers woe
Against that time if ever that time come
When I shall see thee frown on my defects
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
Calld to that audit by advised respects
Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye
When love converted from the thing it was
Shall reasons find of settled gravity
Against that time do I ensconce me here
Within the knowledge of mine own desert
And this my hand against myself uprear
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part
To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
Since why to love I can allege no cause
The other two slight air and purging fire
Are both with thee wherever I abide
The first my thought the other my desire
These presentabsent with swift motion slide
For when these quicker elements are gone
In tender embassy of love to thee
My life being made of four with two alone
Sinks down to death oppressd with melancholy
Until lifes composition be recured
By those swift messengers returnd from thee
Who even but now come back again assured
Of thy fair health recounting it to me
This told I joy but then no longer glad
I send them back again and straight grow sad
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
How to divide the conquest of thy sight
Mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar
My heart mine eye the freedom of that right
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie
A closet never pierced with crystal eyes
But the defendant doth that plea deny
And says in him thy fair appearance lies
To cide this title is impanneled
A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
And by their verdict is determined
The clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part
As thus mine eyes due is thy outward part
And my hearts right thy inward love of heart
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
And each doth good turns now unto the other
When that mine eye is famishd for a look
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
With my loves picture then my eye doth feast
And to the painted banquet bids my heart
Another time mine eye is my hearts guest
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part
So either by thy picture or my love
Thyself away art resent still with me
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
And I am still with them and they with thee
Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
Awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight
How careful was I when I took my way
Each trifle under truest bars to thrust
That to my use it might unused stay
From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust
But thou to whom my jewels trifles are
Most worthy of comfort now my greatest grief
Thou best of dearest and mine only care
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief
Thee have I not lockd up in any chest
Save where thou art not though I feel thou art
Within the gentle closure of my breast
From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
And even thence thou wilt be stoln I fear
For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear
When I consider everything that grows
Holds in perfection but a little moment
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment
When I perceive that men as plants increase
Cheered and checkd even by the selfsame sky
Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
And wear their brave state out of memory
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay
To change your day of youth to sullied night
And all in war with Time for love of you
As he takes from you I engraft you new
But wherefore do not you a mightier way
Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time
And fortify yourself in your decay
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme
Now stand you on the top of happy hours
And many maiden gardens yet unset
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers
Much liker than your painted counterfeit
So should the lines of life that life repair
Which this Times pencil or my pupil pen
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men
To give away yourself keeps yourself still
And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill
Who will believe my verse in time to come
If it were filld with your most high deserts
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts
If I could write the beauty of your eyes
And in fresh numbers number all your graces
The age to come would say This poet lies
Such heavenly touches neer touchd earthly faces
So should my papers yellowd with their age
Be scornd like old men of less truth than tongue
And your true rights be termd a poets rage
And stretched metre of an antique song
But were some child of yours alive that time
You should live twice in it and in my rhyme
Shall I compare thee to a summers day
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
And summers lease hath all too short a date
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
And often is his gold complexion dimmd
And every fair from fair sometime declines
By chance or natures changing course untrimmd
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest
Nor shall Death brag thou wanderst in his shade
When in eternal lines to time thou growest
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see
So long lives this and this gives life to thee
A womans face with Natures own hand painted
Hast thou the mastermistress of my passion
A womans gentle heart but not acquainted
With shifting change as is false womens fashion
An eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
A man in hue all hues in his controlling
Much steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth
And for a woman wert thou first created
Till Nature as she wrought thee fell adoting
And by addition me of thee defeated
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing
But since she prickd thee out for womens pleasure
Mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure
So is it not with me as with that Muse
Stirrd by a painted beauty to his verse
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
Making a couplement of proud compare
With sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems
With Aprils firstborn flowers and all things rare
That heavens air in this huge rondure hems
O let me true in love but truly write
And then believe me my love is as fair
As any mothers child though not so bright
As those gold candles fixd in heavens air
Let them say more than like of hearsay well
I will not praise that purpose not to sell
My glass shall not persuade me I am old
So long as youth and thou are of one date
But when in thee times furrows I behold
Then look I death my days should expiate
For all that beauty that doth cover thee
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart
Which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
How can I then be elder than thou art
O therefore love be of thyself so wary
As I not for myself but for thee will
Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill
Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
Thou gavest me thine not to give back again
Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Flatter the mountaintops with sovereign eye
Kissing with golden face the meadows green
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
With ugly rack on his celestial face
And from the forlorn world his visage hide
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
Even so my sun one early morn did shine
With all triumphant splendor on my brow
But out alack he was but one hour mine
The region cloud hath maskd him from me now
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
Suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth
Mine eye hath playd the painter and hath stelld
Thy beautys form in table of my heart
My body is the frame wherein tis held
And perspective it is the painters art
For through the painter must you see his skill
To find where your true image pictured lies
Which in my bosoms shop is hanging still
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
Are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun
Delights to peep to gaze therein on thee
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
They draw but what they see know not the heart
When in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes
I all alone beweep my outcast state
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
And look upon myself and curse my fate
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope
Featurd like him like him with friends possessd
Although she knows my days are past the best
Simply I credit her falsespeaking tongue
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed
But wherefore says she not she is unjust
And wherefore say not I that I am old
O loves best habit is in seeming trust
And age in love loves not to have years told
Therefore I lie with her and she with me
And in our faults by lies we flattered be
O call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
Use power with power and slay me not by art
Tell me thou lovst elsewhere but in my sight
Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
What needst thou wound with cunning when thy might
Is more than my oerpressed defence can bide
Let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies
And therefore from my face she turns my foes
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries
Yet do not so but since I am near slain
Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain
Be wise as thou art cruel do not press
My tonguetied patience with too much disdain
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express
The manner of my pitywanting pain
If I might teach thee wit better it were
Though not to love yet love to tell me so
As testy sick men when their deaths be near
No news but health from their physicians know
For if I should despair I should grow mad
And in my madness might speak ill of thee
Now this illwresting world is grown so bad
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
That I may not be so nor thou belied
Bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide
In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes
For they in thee a thousand errors note
But tis my heart that loves what they despise
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote
Nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted
Nor tender feeling to base touches prone
Nor taste nor smell desire to be invited
To any sensual feast with thee alone
But my five wits nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be
Only my plague thus far I count my gain
That she that makes me sin awards me pain
Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving
O but with mine compare thou thine own state
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving
Or if it do not from those lips of thine
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine
Robbed others beds revenues of their rents
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lovst those
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
Root pity in thy heart that when it grows
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
By selfexample mayst thou be denied
Lo as a careful housewife runs to catch
One of her featherd creatures broke away
Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
To follow that which flies before her face
Not prizing her poor infants discontent
So runnst thou after that which flies from thee
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind
But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
And play the mothers part kiss me be kind
So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will
If thou turn back and my loud crying still
Two loves I have of comfort and despair
Which like two spirits do suggest me still
The better angel is a man right fair
The worser spirit a woman coloured ill
To win me soon to hell my female evil
Tempteth my better angel from my side
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil
Wooing his purity with her foul pride
And whether that my angel be turned fiend
Suspect I may yet not directly tell
But being both from me both to each friend
I guess one angel in anothers hell
Yet this shall I neer know but live in doubt
Till my bad angel fire my good one out
Those lips that Loves own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said I hate
To me that languished for her sake
But when she saw my woeful state
Straight in her heart did mercy come
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
Was used in giving gentle doom
And taught it thus anew to greet
I hate she altered with an end
That followed it as gentle day
Doth follow night who like a fiend
From heaven to hell is flown away
I hate from hate away she threw
And saved my life saying not you
Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
these rebel powers that thee array
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay
Why so large cost having so short a lease
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
Shall worms inheritors of this excess
Eat up thy charge Is this thy bodys end
Then soul live thou upon thy servants loss
And let that pine to aggravate thy store
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
Within be fed without be rich no more
So shall thou feed on Death that feeds on men
And Death once dead theres no more dying then
My love is as a fever longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
The uncertain sickly appetite to please
My reason the physician to my love
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
Hath left me and I desperate now approve
Desire is death which physic did except
Past cure I am now Reason is past care
And franticmad with evermore unrest
My thoughts and my discourse as madmens are
At random from the truth vainly expressed
For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
Who art as black as hell as dark as night
O me what eyes hath Love put in my head
Which have no correspondence with true sight
Or if they have where is my judgment fled
That censures falsely what they see aright
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
What means the world to say it is not so
If it be not then love doth well denote
Loves eye is not so true as all mens no
How can it O how can Loves eye be true
That is so vexed with watching and with tears
No marvel then though I mistake my view
The sun itself sees not till heaven clears
O cunning Love with tears thou keepst me blind
Lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find
Canst thou O cruel say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake
Do I not think on thee when I forgot
Am of my self all tyrant for thy sake
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend
On whom frownst thou that I do fawn upon
Nay if thou lourst on me do I not spend
Revenge upon myself with present moan
What merit do I in my self respect
That is so proud thy service to despise
When all my best doth worship thy defect
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes
But love hate on for now I know thy mind
Those that can see thou lovst and I am blind
O from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway
To make me give the lie to my true sight
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
That in the very refuse of thy deeds
There is such strength and warrantise of skill
That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more
The more I hear and see just cause of hate
O though I love what others do abhor
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state
If thy unworthiness raised love in me
More worthy I to be beloved of thee
Love is too young to know what conscience is
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love
Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
For thou betraying me I do betray
My nobler part to my gross bodys treason
My soul doth tell my body that he may
Triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason
But rising at thy name doth point out thee
As his triumphant prize Proud of this pride
He is contented thy poor drudge to be
To stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
No want of conscience hold it that I call
Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall
In loving thee thou knowst I am forsworn
But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
In act thy bedvow broke and new faith torn
In vowing new hate after new love bearing
But why of two oaths breach do I accuse thee
When I break twenty I am perjured most
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
And all my honest faith in thee is lost
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
Oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
Or made them swear against the thing they see
For I have sworn thee fair more perjured eye
To swear against the truth so foul a lie
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
A maid of Dians this advantage found
And his lovekindling fire did quickly steep
In a cold valleyfountain of that ground
Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love
A dateless lively heat still to endure
And grew a seething bath which yet men prove
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure
But at my mistress eye Loves brand newfired
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast
I sick withal the help of bath desired
And thither hied a sad distempered guest
But found no cure the bath for my help lies
Where Cupid got new fire my mistress eyes
The little Lovegod lying once asleep
Laid by his side his heartinflaming brand
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
Came tripping by but in her maiden hand
The fairest votary took up that fire
Which many legions of true hearts had warmed
And so the General of hot desire
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed
This brand she quenched in a cool well by
Which from Loves fire took heat perpetual
Growing a bath and healthful remedy
For men diseased but I my mistress thrall
Came there for cure and this by that I prove
Loves fire heats water water cools not love
When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies
That she might think me some untutord youth
Unskilful in the worlds false forgeries
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
Although I know my years be past the best
I smiling credit her falsespeaking tongue
Outfacing faults in love with loves ill rest
But wherefore says my love that she is young
And wherefore say not I that I am old
O loves best habit is a soothing tongue
And age in love loves not to have years told
Therefore Ill lie with love and love with me
Since that our faults in love thus smotherd be
Two loves I have of comfort and despair
That like two spirits do suggest me still
My better angel is a man right fair
My worser spirit a woman colourd ill
To win me soon to hell my female evil
Tempteth my better angel from my side
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil
Wooing his purity with her fair pride
And whether that my angel be turnd fiend
Suspect I may yet not directly tell
For being both to me both to each friend
I guess one angel in anothers hell
The truth I shall not know but live in doubt
Till my bad angel fire my good one out
Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye
Gainst whom the world could not hold argument
Persuade my heart to this false perjury
Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment
A woman I forswore but I will prove
Thou being a goddess I forswore not thee
My vow was earthly thou a heavenly love
Thy grace being gaind cures all disgrace in me
My vow was breath and breath a vapour is
Then thou fair sun that on this earth doth shine
Exhale this vapour vow in thee it is
If broken then it is no fault of mine
If by me broke what fool is not so wise
To break an oath to win a paradise
Sweet Cytherea sitting by a brook
With young Adonis lovely fresh and green
Did court the lad with many a lovely look
Such looks as none could look but beautys queen
She told him stories to delight his ear
She showd him favours to allure his eye
To win his heart she touchd him here and there
Touches so soft still conquer chastity
But whether unripe years did want conceit
Or he refused to take her figured proffer
The tender nibbler would not touch the bait
But smile and jest at every gentle offer
Then fell she on her back fair queen and toward
He rose and ran away ah fool too froward
If love make me forsworn how shall I swear to love
O never faith could hold if not to beauty vowd
Though to myself forsworn to thee Ill constant prove
Those thoughts to me like oaks to thee like osiers bowd
Study his bias leaves and make his book thine eyes
Where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend
If knowledge be the mark to know thee shall suffice
Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend
All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder
Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire
Thy eye Joves lightning seems thy voice his dreadful thunder
Which not to anger bent is music and sweet fire
Celestial as thou art O do not love that wrong
To sing heavens praise with such an earthly tongue
Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn
And scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade
When Cytherea all in love forlorn
A longing tarriance for Adonis made
Under an osier growing by a brook
A brook where Adon used to cool his spleen
Hot was the day she hotter that did look
For his approach that often there had been
Anon he comes and throws his mantle by
And stood stark naked on the brooks green brim
The sun lookd on the world with glorious eye
Yet not so wistly as this queen on him
He spying her bounced in whereas he stood
O Jove quoth she why was not I a flood
Fair is my love but not so fair as fickle
Mild as a dove but neither true nor trusty
Brighter than glass and yet as glass is brittle
Softer than wax and yet as iron rusty
A lily pale with damask dye to grace her
None fairer nor none falser to deface her
Her lips to mine how often hath she joined
Between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing
How many tales to please me bath she coined
Dreading my love the loss thereof still fearing
Yet in the midst of all her pure protestings
Her faith her oaths her tears and all were jestings
She burnd with love as straw with fire flameth
She burnd out love as soon as straw outburneth
She framed the love and yet she foild the framing
She bade love last and yet she fell aturning
Was this a lover or a lecher whether
Bad in the best though excellent in neither
If music and sweet poetry agree
As they must needs the sister and the brother
Then must the love be great twixt thee and me
Because thou lovest the one and I the other
Dowland to thee is dear whose heavenly touch
Upon the lute doth ravish human sense
Spenser to me whose deep conceit is such
As passing all conceit needs no defence
Thou lovest to bear the sweet melodious sound
That Phoebus lute the queen of music makes
And I in deep delight am chiefly drownd
Whenas himself to singing he betakes
One god is god of both as poets feign
One knight loves both and both in thee remain
Fair was the morn when the fair queen of love
Paler for sorrow than her milkwhite dove
For Adons sake a youngster proud and wild
Her stand she takes upon a steepup hill
Anon Adonis comes with horn and hounds
She silly queen with more than loves good will
Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds
Once quoth she did I see a fair sweet youth
Here in these brakes deepwounded with a boar
Deep in the thigh a spectacle of ruth
See in my thigh quoth she here was the sore
She showed hers he saw more wounds than one
And blushing fled and left her all alone
Sweet rose fair flower untimely pluckd soon vaded
Pluckd in the bud and vaded in the spring
Bright orient pearl alack too timely shaded
Fair creature killd too soon by deaths sharp sting
Like a green plum that hangs upon a tree
And falls through wind before the fall should he
I weep for thee and yet no cause I have
For why thou leftst me nothing in thy will
And yet thou leftst me more than I did crave
For why I craved nothing of thee still
O yes dear friend I pardon crave of thee
Thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me
Venus with young Adonis sitting by her
Under a myrtle shade began to woo him
She told the youngling how god Mars did try her
And as he fell to her so fell she to him
Even thus quoth she the warlike god embraced me
And then she clippd Adonis in her arms
Even thus quoth she the warlike god unlaced me
As if the boy should use like loving charms
Even thus quoth she he seized on my lips
And with her lips on his did act the seizure
And as she fetched breath away he skips
And would not take her meaning nor her pleasure
Ah that I had my lady at this bay
To kiss and clip me till I run away
Crabbed age and youth cannot live together
Youth is full of pleasance age is full of care
Youth like summer morn age like winter weather
Youth like summer brave age like winter bare
Youth is full of sport ages breath is short
Youth is nimble age is lame
Youth is hot and bold age is weak and cold
Youth is wild and age is tame
Age I do abhor thee youth I do adore thee
O my love my love is young
Age I do defy thee O sweet shepherd hie thee
For methinks thou stayst too long
Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good
A shining gloss that vadeth suddenly
A flower that dies when first it gins to bud
A brittle glass thats broken presently
A doubtful good a gloss a glass a flower
Lost vaded broken dead within an hour
And as goods lost are seld or never found
As vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh
As flowers dead lie witherd on the ground
As broken glass no cement can redress
So beauty blemishd onces for ever lost
In spite of physic painting pain and cost
Good night good rest Ah neither be my share
She bade good night that kept my rest away
And daffd me to a cabin hangd with care
To descant on the doubts of my decay
Farewell quoth she and come again tomorrow
Fare well I could not for I suppd with sorrow
Yet at my parting sweetly did she smile
In scorn or friendship nill I construe whether
T may be she joyd to jest at my exile
T may be again to make me wander thither
Wander a word for shadows like myself
As take the pain but cannot pluck the pelf
Lord how mine eyes throw gazes to the east
My heart doth charge the watch the morning rise
Doth cite each moving sense from idle rest
Not daring trust the office of mine eyes
While Philomela sits and sings I sit and mark
And wish her lays were tuned like the lark
For she doth welcome daylight with her ditty
And drives away dark dismaldreaming night
The night so packd I post unto my pretty
Heart hath his hope and eyes their wished sight
Sorrow changed to solace solace mixd with sorrow
For why she sighd and bade me come tomorrow
Were I with her the night would post too soon
But now are minutes added to the hours
To spite me now each minute seems a moon
Yet not for me shine sun to succour flowers
Pack night peep day good day of night now borrow
Short night tonight and length thyself tomorrow
Let the bird of loudest lay
On the sole Arabian tree
Herald sad and trumpet be
To whose sound chaste wings obey
But thou shrieking harbinger
Foul precurrer of the fiend
Augur of the fevers end
To this troop come thou not near
From this session interdict
Every fowl of tyrant wing
Save the eagle featherd king
Keep the obsequy so strict
Let the priest in surplice white
That defunctive music can
Be the deathdivining swan
Lest the requiem lack his right
And thou trebledated crow
That thy sable gender makst
With the breath thou givst and takst
Mongst our mourners shalt thou go
Here the anthem doth commence
Love and constancy is dead
Phoenix and the turtle fled
In a mutual flame from hence
So they lovd as love in twain
Had the essence but in one
Two distincts division none
Number there in love was slain
Hearts remote yet not asunder
Distance and no space was seen
Twixt the turtle and his queen
But in them it were a wonder
So between them love did shine
That the turtle saw his right
Flaming in the phoenix sight
Either was the others mine
Property was thus appalld
That the self was not the same
Single natures double name
Neither two nor one was calld
Reason in itself confounded
Saw division grow together
To themselves yet eitherneither
Simple were so well compounded
That it cried how true a twain
Seemeth this concordant one
Love hath reason reason none
If what parts can so remain
Whereupon it made this threne
To the phoenix and the dove
Cosupreme and stars of love
As chorus to their tragic scene
Beauty truth and rarity
Grace in all simplicity
Here enclosd in cinders lie
Death is now the phoenix nest
And the turtles loyal breast
To eternity doth rest
Leaving no posterity
Twas not their infirmity
It was married chastity
Truth may seem but cannot be
Beauty brag but tis not she
Truth and beauty buried be
To this urn let those repair
That are either true or fair
For these dead birds sigh a prayer
From fairest creatures we desire increase
That thereby beautys rose might never die
But as the riper should by time decease
His tender heir might bear his memory
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
Feedst thy lights flame with selfsubstantial fuel
Making a famine where abundance lies
Thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
Thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
And tender churl makst waste in niggarding
Pity the world or else this glutton be
To eat the worlds due by the grave and thee
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
And dig deep trenches in thy beautys field
Thy youths proud livery so gazed on now
Will be a totterd weed of small worth held
Then being asked where all thy beauty lies
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days
To say within thine own deep sunken eyes
Were an alleating shame and thriftless praise
How much more praise deservd thy beautys use
If thou couldst answer This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse
Proving his beauty by succession thine
This were to be new made when thou art old
And see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
Now is the time that face should form another
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
For where is she so fair whose uneard womb
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
Of his selflove to stop posterity
Thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee
Calls back the lovely April of her prime
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
But if thou live rememberd not to be
Die single and thine image dies with thee
Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
Upon thy self thy beautys legacy
Natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend
And being frank she lends to those are free
Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
The bounteous largess given thee to give
Profitless usurer why dost thou use
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live
For having traffic with thy self alone
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone
What acceptable audit canst thou leave
Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee
Which used lives th executor to be
Those hours that with gentle work did frame
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
Will play the tyrants to the very same
And that unfair which fairly doth excel
For neverresting time leads summer on
To hideous winter and confounds him there
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
Beauty oersnowed and bareness every where
Then were not summers distillation left
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
Beautys effect with beauty were bereft
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was
But flowers distilld though they with winter meet
Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
Then let not winters ragged hand deface
In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled
Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
With beautys treasure ere it be selfkilled
That use is not forbidden usury
Which happies those that pay the willing loan
Thats for thy self to breed another thee
Or ten times happier be it ten for one
Ten times thy self were happier than thou art
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
Leaving thee living in posterity
Be not selfwilled for thou art much too fair
To be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir
Lo in the orient when the gracious light
Lifts up his burning head each under eye
Doth homage to his newappearing sight
Serving with looks his sacred majesty
And having climbed the steepup heavenly hill
Resembling strong youth in his middle age
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
Attending on his golden pilgrimage
But when from highmost pitch with weary car
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day
The eyes fore duteous now converted are
From his low tract and look another way
So thou thyself outgoing in thy noon
Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son
Music to hear why hearst thou music sadly
Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
Why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly
Or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy
If the true concord of welltuned sounds
By unions married do offend thine ear
They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
Mark how one string sweet husband to another
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering
Resembling sire and child and happy mother
Who all in one one pleasing note do sing
Whose speechless song being many seeming one
Sings this to thee Thou single wilt prove none
Is it for fear to wet a widows eye
That thou consumst thy self in single life
Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife
The world will be thy widow and still weep
That thou no form of thee hast left behind
When every private widow well may keep
By childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
But beautys waste hath in the world an end
And kept unused the user so destroys it
No love toward others in that bosom sits
That on himself such murdrous shame commits
For shame deny that thou bearst love to any
Who for thy self art so unprovident
Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
But that thou none lovst is most evident
For thou art so possessed with murderous hate
That gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Which to repair should be thy chief desire
O change thy thought that I may change my mind
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
Be as thy presence is gracious and kind
Or to thyself at least kindhearted prove
Make thee another self for love of me
That beauty still may live in thine or thee
As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growst
In one of thine from that which thou departest
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
Herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
Without this folly age and cold decay
If all were minded so the times should cease
And threescore year would make the world away
Let those whom nature hath not made for store
Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
Look whom she best endowd she gave the more
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
She carvd thee for her seal and meant thereby
Thou shouldst print more not let that copy die
When I do count the clock that tells the time
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night
When I behold the violet past prime
And sable curls all silvered oer with white
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
And summers green all girded up in sheaves
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
Then of thy beauty do I question make
That thou among the wastes of time must go
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
And die as fast as they see others grow
And nothing gainst Times scythe can make defence
Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence
O that you were your self but love you are
No longer yours than you your self here live
Against this coming end you should prepare
And your sweet semblance to some other give
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Find no determination then you were
Yourself again after yourselfs decease
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay
Which husbandry in honour might uphold
Against the stormy gusts of winters day
And barren rage of deaths eternal cold
O none but unthrifts Dear my love you know
You had a father let your son say so
Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck
And yet methinks I have Astronomy
But not to tell of good or evil luck
Of plagues of dearths or seasons quality
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell
Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
Or say with princes if it shall go well
By oft predict that I in heaven find
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive
And constant stars in them I read such art
As truth and beauty shall together thrive
If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert
Or else of thee this I prognosticate
Thy end is truths and beautys doom and date
When I consider every thing that grows
Holds in perfection but a little moment
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment
When I perceive that men as plants increase
Cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky
Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
And wear their brave state out of memory
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight
Where wasteful Time debateth with decay
To change your day of youth to sullied night
And all in war with Time for love of you
As he takes from you I engraft you new
But wherefore do not you a mightier way
Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time
And fortify your self in your decay
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme
Now stand you on the top of happy hours
And many maiden gardens yet unset
With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers
Much liker than your painted counterfeit
So should the lines of life that life repair
Which this Times pencil or my pupil pen
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
Can make you live your self in eyes of men
To give away yourself keeps yourself still
And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill
Who will believe my verse in time to come
If it were filld with your most high deserts
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts
If I could write the beauty of your eyes
And in fresh numbers number all your graces
The age to come would say This poet lies
Such heavenly touches neer touchd earthly faces
So should my papers yellowd with their age
Be scornd like old men of less truth than tongue
And your true rights be termd a poets rage
And stretched metre of an antique song
But were some child of yours alive that time
You should live twice in it and in my rhyme
The quality of mercy is not straind
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath It is twice blest
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes
Tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown
His scepter shows the force of temporal power
The attribute to awe and majesty
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings
But mercy is above this sceptered sway
It is enthroned in the heart of kings
It is an attribute to God himself
And earthly power doth then show likest Gods
When mercy seasons justice
So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse
And found such fair assistance in my verse
As every alien pen hath got my use
And under thee their poesy disperse
Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly
Have added feathers to the learneds wing
And given grace a double majesty
Yet be most proud of that which I compile
Whose influence is thine and born of thee
In others works thou dost but mend the style
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be
But thou art all my art and dost advance
As high as learning my rude ignorance
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace
But now my gracious numbers are decayd
And my sick Muse doth give an other place
I grant sweet love thy lovely argument
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
He robs thee of and pays it thee again
He lends thee virtue and he stole that word
From thy behaviour beauty doth he give
And found it in thy cheek he can afford
No praise to thee but what in thee doth live
Then thank him not for that which he doth say
Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay
O how I faint when I of you do write
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name
And in the praise thereof spends all his might
To make me tonguetied speaking of your fame
But since your worth wide as the ocean is
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear
My saucy bark inferior far to his
On your broad main doth wilfully appear
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
Or being wrackd I am a worthless boat
He of tall building and of goodly pride
Then if he thrive and I be cast away
The worst was this my love was my decay
Or I shall live your epitaph to make
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten
From hence your memory death cannot take
Although in me each part will be forgotten
Your name from hence immortal life shall have
Though I once gone to all the world must die
The earth can yield me but a common grave
When you entombed in mens eyes shall lie
Your monument shall be my gentle verse
Which eyes not yet created shall oerread
And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
When all the breathers of this world are dead
You still shall live such virtue hath my pen
Where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men
I grant thou wert not married to my Muse
And therefore mayst without attaint oerlook
The dedicated words which writers use
Of their fair subject blessing every book
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise
And therefore art enforced to seek anew
Some fresher stamp of the timebettering days
And do so love yet when they have devisd
What strained touches rhetoric can lend
Thou truly fair wert truly sympathizd
In true plain words by thy truetelling friend
And their gross painting might be better usd
Where cheeks need blood in thee it is abusd
I never saw that you did painting need
And therefore to your fair no painting set
I found or thought I found you did exceed
The barren tender of a poets debt
And therefore have I slept in your report
That you yourself being extant well might show
How far a modern quill doth come too short
Speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
This silence for my sin you did impute
Which shall be most my glory being dumb
For I impair not beauty being mute
When others would give life and bring a tomb
There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
Than both your poets can in praise devise
Who is it that says most which can say more
Than this rich praise that you alone are you
In whose confine immured is the store
Which should example where your equal grew
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
That to his subject lends not some small glory
But he that writes of you if he can tell
That you are you so dignifies his story
Let him but copy what in you is writ
Not making worse what nature made so clear
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit
Making his style admired every where
You to your beauteous blessings add a curse
Being fond on praise which makes your praises worse
My tonguetied Muse in manners holds her still
While comments of your praise richly compiled
Reserve thy character with golden quill
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed
I think good thoughts whilst others write good words
And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen
To every hymn that able spirit affords
In polished form of wellrefined pen
Hearing you praised I say tis so tis true
And to the most of praise add something more
But that is in my thought whose love to you
Though words come hindmost holds his rank before
Then others for the breath of words respect
Me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse
Bound for the prize of all too precious you
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
Was it his spirit by spirits taught to write
Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
No neither he nor his compeers by night
Giving him aid my verse astonished
He nor that affable familiar ghost
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence
As victors of my silence cannot boast
I was not sick of any fear from thence
But when your countenance filled up his line
Then lacked I matter that enfeebled mine
To be or not to be that is the question
Whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them To die to sleep
No more and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to it is a consummation
Devoutly to be wished To die to sleep
To sleep perchance to dream ay there is the rub
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil
Must give us pause there is the respect
That makes calamity of so long life
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time
The oppressores wrong the proud mans contumely
The pangs of despised love the laws delay
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin who would fardels bear
To grunt and sweat under a weary life
But that the dread of something after death
The undiscoverd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action Soft you now
The fair Ophelia Nymph in thy orisons
Be all my sins rememberd
Through the house give glimmering light
By the dead and drowsy fire
Every elf and fairy sprite
hop as light as bird from brier
Now until the break of day
Through this house each fairy stray
Under the greenwood tree
Who loves to lie with me
And turn his merry note
Unto the sweet birds throat
Come hither come hither come hither
Here shall he see
No enemy
But winter and rough weather
Who doth ambition shun
And loves to live i the sun
Seeking the food he eats
And pleasd with what he gets
Come hither come hither come hither
Here shall he see
No enemy
But winter and rough weather
When in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes
I all alone beweep my outcast state
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
And look upon myself and curse my fate
wishing me like to one more rich in hope
Featured like him like him with friends possessed
Desiring this mans art and that mans scope
With what I most enjoy contented least
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising
Haply I think on theeand then my state
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings
When that I was and a little tiny boy
With hey ho the wind and the rain
A foolish thing was but a toy
For the rain it raineth every day
But when I came to mans estate
With hey ho
Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate
For the rain
But when I came alas to wive
With hey ho
By swaggering could I never thrive
For the rain
But when I came unto my beds
With hey ho
With tosspots still had drunken heads
For the rain
A great while ago the world begun
With hey ho
But thats all one our play is done
And well strive to please you every day
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought
And with old woes new wail my dear times waste
Then can I drown an eye unused to flow
For precious friends hid in deaths dateless night
And weep afresh loves long since cancelled woe
And moan the expense of many a vanished sight
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone
And heavily from woe to woe tell oer
The sad account of forebemoaned moan
Which I new pay as if not paid before
But if the while I think on thee dear friend
All losses are restored and sorrows end
WHERE the bee sucks there suck I
In a cowslips bell I lie
There I couch when owls do cry
On the bats back I do fly
After summer merrily
Merrily merrily shall I live now
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough
Good frend for Iesvs sake forebeare
To digg the dvst encloased heare
Bleste be Middle English thesvg man Middle English thatsvg spares thes stones
And cvrst be he Middle English thatsvg moves my bones
In modern spelling
Good friend for Jesus sake forbear
To dig the dust enclosed here
Blessed be the man that spares these stones
And cursed be he that moves my bones
When icicles hang by the wall
And Dick the shepherd blows his nail
And Tom bears logs into the hall
And milk comes frozen home in pail
When Blood is nipped and ways be foul
Then nightly sings the staring owl
Tuwho
Tuwhit tuwho a merry note
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot
When all aloud the wind doth blow
And coughing drowns the parsons saw
And birds sit brooding in the snow
And Marians nose looks red and raw
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl
Then nightly sings the staring owl
Tuwho
Tuwhit tuwho a merry note
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot
Round about the couldron go
In the poisones entrails throw
Toadthat under cold stone
Days and nights has thirtyone
Sweated venom sleeping got
Boil thou first in the charmed pot
Doubledouble toil and trouble
Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Fillet of a fenny snake
In the cauldron boil and bake
Eye of newt and toe of frog
Wool of bat and tongue of dog
Adders fork and blindworms sting
Lizards leg and howlets wing
For charm of powerful trouble
Like a hellbroth boil and bubble
Doubledouble toil and trouble
Fire burn and couldron bubble
Scale of dragontooth of wolf
Witchs mummy maw and gulf
Of the ravind saltsea shark
Root of hemlock diggd in the dark
Liver of blaspheming Jew
Gall of goat andslips of yew
silverd in the moons eclipse
Nose of Turk and Tartars lips
Finger of birthstrangled babe
Ditchdeliverd by the drab
Make the gruel thick and slab
Add thereto a tigers chaudron
For ingrediants of our cauldron
Doubledouble toil and trouble
