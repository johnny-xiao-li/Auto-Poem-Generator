# Auto-Poem Generator

## Introduction
In this project, I want to combine artificial intelligence (AI) with human literature. Literature is the art of human expression, and artificial intelligence is a medium that humans create with creativity and learning ability. I want to talk about artificial intelligence to learn human language art and form computer literature through its creativity. The combination of the two will produce many interesting results. Through the establishment on the Twitter platform, display the results of computer creation. Finally, a basic framework for combining artificial intelligence and literature is formed. I built the framework in this project and tried some interesting applications. I believe it will lay the foundation for future development.
